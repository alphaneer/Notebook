	abstract = {Single-cell genomics has now made it possible to create a comprehensive atlas of human cells. At the same time, it has reopened definitions of a cell's identity and of the ways in which identity is regulated by the cell's molecular circuitry. Emerging computational analysis methods, especially in single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq), have already begun to reveal, in a data-driven way, the diverse simultaneous facets of a cell's identity, from discrete cell types to continuous dynamic transitions and spatial locations. These developments will eventually allow a cell to be represented as a superposition of 'basis vectors', each determining a different (but possibly dependent) aspect of cellular organization and function. However, computational methods must also overcome considerable challenges—from handling technical noise and data scale to forming new abstractions of biology. As the scale of single-cell experiments continues to increase, new computational approaches will be essential for constructing and characterizing a reference map of cell identities.},

Single-cell genomics is opening up new ways to tackle these questions by combining the comprehensive nature of genomics with the microscopic resolution that is required to describe complex multicellular systems. Initial single-cell genomic studies provided a remarkably rich phenomenology of heterogeneous cellular states, but transforming observational studies into models of dynamics and causal mechanisms in tissues poses fresh challenges and requires stronger integration of theoretical, computational and experimental frameworks.},

	abstract = {Summary
Adult mitotic tissues like the intestine, skin, and blood undergo constant turnover throughout the life of an organism. Knowing the identity of the stem cell is crucial to understanding tissue homeostasis and its aberrations upon disease. Here we present a computational method for the derivation of a lineage tree from single-cell transcriptome data. By exploiting the tree topology and the transcriptome composition, we establish {StemID}, an algorithm for identifying stem cells among all detectable cell types within a population. We demonstrate that {StemID} recovers two known adult stem cell populations, Lgr5+ cells in the small intestine and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. We apply {StemID} to predict candidate multipotent cell populations in the human pancreas, a tissue with largely uncharacterized turnover dynamics. We hope that {StemID} will accelerate the search for novel stem cells by providing concrete markers for biological follow-up and validation.},

	abstract = {In this work, we investigate morphological differences between Arabidopsis thaliana, which has simple leaves, and its relative Cardamine hirsuta, which has dissected leaves comprising distinct leaflets. With the use of genetics, interspecific gene transfers, and time-lapse imaging, we show that leaflet development requires the {REDUCED} {COMPLEXITY} ({RCO}) homeodomain protein. {RCO} functions specifically in leaves, where it sculpts developing leaflets by repressing growth at their flanks. {RCO} evolved in the Brassicaceae family through gene duplication and was lost in A. thaliana, contributing to leaf simplification in this species. Species-specific {RCO} action with respect to its paralog results from its distinct gene expression pattern in the leaf base. Thus, regulatory evolution coupled with gene duplication and loss generated leaf shape diversity by modifying local growth patterns during organogenesis.
Developmental Complexity
Although related, the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta have different sorts of leaves—one, a rather plain oval and the other, a complicated multipart construction. Comparing the development of the two leaf types, Vlad et al. (p. 780) uncovered a gene that regulates developmental growth. The C. hirsuta gene encoding the {REDUCED} {COMPLEXITY} ({RCO}) homeodomain protein arose through gene duplication and neofunctionalization, but was lost in the A. thaliana lineage. In C. hirsuta, {RCO} suppresses growth in domains around the perimeter of the developing leaf, yielding complex-shaped leaves. A. thaliana, lacking {RCO}, produces simple leaves. When {RCO} was expressed in A. thaliana, the leaves became more complex. Thus, the capacity to produce complex leaves remains, despite loss of the initiator.
The evolutionary trajectory leading to crucifer leaf shape in Cardamine hirsuta plants is elucidated.

	abstract = {Ca2+‐sensor proteins are generally implicated in insulin release through {SNARE} interactions. Here, secretagogin, whose expression in human pancreatic islets correlates with their insulin content and the incidence of type 2 diabetes, is shown to orchestrate an unexpectedly distinct mechanism. Single‐cell {RNA}‐seq reveals retained expression of the {TRP} family members in β‐cells from diabetic donors. Amongst these, pharmacological probing identifies Ca2+‐permeable transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 channels ({TRPV}1) as potent inducers of secretagogin expression through recruitment of Sp1 transcription factors. Accordingly, agonist stimulation of {TRPV}1s fails to rescue insulin release from pancreatic islets of glucose intolerant secretagogin knock‐out(−/−) mice. However, instead of merely impinging on the {SNARE} machinery, reduced insulin availability in secretagogin−/− mice is due to β‐cell loss, which is underpinned by the collapse of protein folding and deregulation of secretagogin‐dependent {USP}9X deubiquitinase activity. Therefore, and considering the desensitization of {TRPV}1s in diabetic pancreata, a {TRPV}1‐to‐secretagogin regulatory axis seems critical to maintain the structural integrity and signal competence of β‐cells.
Synopsis

{TRPV}1 activates Sp1‐mediated secretagogin transcription in pancreatic β‐cells to regulate β‐cell survival, {ER} stress and glucose tolerance.

Single‐cell {RNA}‐seq maps the expression of {TRP} family members to pancreatic β‐cells.Ca2+ entry through {TRP} family channels regulates secretagogin transcription in β‐cells via the Ca2+‐dependent transcription factor Sp1.Secretagogin knock‐out mice are insensitive to the pharmacological activation of {TRPV}1 receptors.Secretagogin knock‐out mice are glucose intolerant and suffer from endoplasmic reticulum stress due to the breakdown of protein chaperone availability. In healthy and type 2 diabetic human β‐cells secretagogin {mRNA} expression correlates with those of insulin, {ATF}4 and {CHOP}.Ca2+‐bound secretagogin interacts with {USP}9X and {USP}7 to regulate β‐cell turnover. Pharmacological modulation of protein degradation rescues β‐cell viability.},

Applying Expedition to single pluripotent stem cells undergoing neuronal differentiation, we discover that up to 20\% of {AS} exons exhibit bimodality. Bimodal exons are flanked by more conserved intronic sequences harboring distinct cis-regulatory motifs, constitute much of cell-type-specific splicing, are highly dynamic during cellular transitions, preserve reading frame, and reveal intricacy of cell states invisible to conventional gene expression analysis.

	abstract = {How the bi-potential hepatoblasts differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes remains unclear. Here, using single-cell transcriptomic analysis of hepatoblasts, hepatocytes, and cholangiocytes sorted from E10.5 to E17.5 mouse embryos, we found that hepatoblast-to-hepatocyte differentiation occurred gradually followed a linear default pathway. As more cells became fully differentiated hepatocytes, the number of proliferating cells decreased. Surprisingly, the proliferating and quiescent hepatoblasts exhibited homogeneous differentiation states at a given developmental stage. This unique feature enabled us to combine the single-cell and bulk-cell analyses to define the precise timing of the hepatoblast-to-hepatocyte transition, which occurs between E13.5 and E15.5. In contrast to hepatocyte development at almost all levels, hepatoblast-to-cholangiocyte differentiation underwent a sharp detour from the default pathway. New cholangiocyte generation occurred continuously between E11.5 and E14.5, but their maturation states at a given developmental stage were heterogeneous. Even more surprising, the number of proliferating cells increased as more progenitor cells differentiated into mature cholangiocytes. Based on an observation from the single-cell analysis, we also discovered that the protein kinase C ({PKC})/mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) signaling pathway promoted cholangiocyte maturation. Conclusions: Our studies have defined distinct pathways for hepatocyte and cholangiocyte development in vivo, which are critically important for understanding basic liver biology and developing effective strategies to induce stem cells to differentiate towards specific hepatic cell fates in vitro.

The Polycomb repressive complex 1 ({PRC}1) is required for decisions of stem cell fate. In mouse embryonic stem cells ({ESCs}), two major variations of {PRC}1 complex, defined by the mutually exclusive presence of Cbx7 or {RYBP}, have been identified. Here, we show that although the genomic localization of the Cbx7- and {RYBP}-containing {PRC}1 complexes overlaps in certain genes, it can also be mutually exclusive. At the molecular level, Cbx7 is necessary for recruitment of Ring1B to chromatin, whereas {RYBP} enhances the {PRC}1 enzymatic activity. Genes occupied by {RYBP} show lower levels of Ring1B and H2AK119ub and are consequently more highly transcribed than those bound by Cbx7. At the functional level, we show that genes occupied by {RYBP} are primarily involved in the regulation of metabolism and cell-cycle progression, whereas those bound by Cbx7 predominantly control early-lineage commitment of {ESCs}. Altogether, our results indicate that different {PRC}1 subtypes establish a complex pattern of gene regulation that regulates common and nonoverlapping aspects of {ESC} pluripotency and differentiation.},

	abstract = {Summary
Polycomb group proteins are essential regulators of cell fate decisions during embryogenesis. In mammals, at least five different Cbx proteins (Cbx2, Cbx4, Cbx6, Cbx7, and Cbx8) are known to associate with the core Polycomb repressive complex 1 ({PRC}1). Here we show that pluripotency and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells ({ESCs}) is regulated by different Cbx-associated {PRC}1 complexes with unique functions. Maintenance of pluripotency primarily depends on Cbx7, while lineage commitment is orchestrated by Cbx2 and Cbx4. At the molecular level, we have uncovered a Polycomb autoregulatory loop in which Cbx7 represses the expression of prodifferentiation Cbx proteins, thereby maintaining the pluripotent state. We additionally show that the occupancy of Cbx7 on promoters is completely dependent on {PRC}2 activity but only partially dependent on a functional {PRC}1 complex. Thus, Cbx proteins confer distinct target selectivity to the {PRC}1 complex, achieving a balance between the self-renewal and the differentiation of {ESCs}.},

Single-cell sequencing is challenging owing to the limited biological material available in an individual cell and the high cost of sequencing across multiple cells. Cao et al. developed a two-step combinatorial barcoding method to profile both single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes without requiring physical isolation of each cell. The authors profiled almost 50,000 single cells from an individual Caenorhabditis elegans larva and were able to identify and recover information from different, even rare, cell types.
Science, this issue p. 661
To resolve cellular heterogeneity, we developed a combinatorial indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of single cells or nuclei, termed sci-{RNA}-seq (single-cell combinatorial indexing {RNA} sequencing). We applied sci-{RNA}-seq to profile nearly 50,000 cells from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans at the L2 larval stage, which provided {\textgreater}50-fold “shotgun” cellular coverage of its somatic cell composition. From these data, we defined consensus expression profiles for 27 cell types and recovered rare neuronal cell types corresponding to as few as one or two cells in the L2 worm. We integrated these profiles with whole-animal chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data to deconvolve the cell type–specific effects of transcription factors. The data generated by sci-{RNA}-seq constitute a powerful resource for nematode biology and foreshadow similar atlases for other organisms.
Single-cell combinatorial indexing {RNA} sequencing achieves more than 50-fold cellular coverage of a developing nematode worm.

The overall genetic diversity among cultivated species of cotton and the genetic changes that occurred during their improvement are poorly understood. Here we report a comprehensive genomic assessment of modern improved upland cotton based on the genome-wide resequencing of 318 landraces and modern improved cultivars or lines. We detected more associated loci for lint yield than for fiber quality, which suggests that lint yield has stronger selection signatures than other traits. We found that two ethylene-pathway-related genes were associated with increased lint yield in improved cultivars. We evaluated the population frequency of each elite allele in historically released cultivar groups and found that 54.8\% of the elite genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) alleles detected were transferred from three founder landraces: Deltapine 15, Stoneville 2B and Uganda Mian. Our results provide a genomic basis for improving cotton cultivars and for further evolutionary analysis of polyploid crops.},

The much smaller 125-Mb genome of A. thaliana, which diverged from A. lyrata 10 million years ago, likely constitutes the derived state for the family. We found evidence for {DNA} loss from large-scale rearrangements, but most of the difference in genome size can be attributed to hundreds of thousands of small deletions, mostly in noncoding {DNA} and transposons. Analysis of deletions and insertions still segregating in A. thaliana indicates that the process of {DNA} loss is ongoing, suggesting pervasive selection for a smaller genome.

	abstract = {Whole genome duplication ({WGD}), which gives rise to polyploids, is a unique type of mutation that duplicates all the genetic material in a genome. {WGD} provides an evolutionary opportunity by generating abundant genetic “raw material,” and has been implicated in diversification, speciation, adaptive radiation, and invasiveness, and has also played an important role in crop breeding. However, {WGD} at least initially challenges basic biological functions by increasing cell size, altering relationships between cell volume and {DNA} content, and doubling the number of homologous chromosome copies that must be sorted during cell division. Newly polyploid lineages often have extensive changes in gene regulation, genome structure, and may suffer meiotic or mitotic chromosome mis-segregation. The abundance of species that persist in nature as polyploids shows that these problems are surmountable and/or that advantages of {WGD} might outweigh drawbacks. The molecularly especially tractable Arabidopsis genus has several ancient polyploidy events in its history and contains several independent more recent polyploids. This genus can thus provide important insights into molecular aspects of polyploid formation, establishment, and genome evolution. The ability to integrate ecological and evolutionary questions with molecular and genetic understanding makes comparative analyses in this genus particularly attractive and holds promise for advancing our general understanding of polyploid biology. Here, we highlight some of the findings from Arabidopsis that have given us insights into the origin and evolution of polyploids.},

Cluster analysis identified seven groups, corresponding to described species that capture the structure of the genus. However, at the level of gene trees, only the separation of Arabidopsis thaliana from the remaining species was universally supported, and, overall, the amount of shared polymorphism demonstrated that reproductive isolation was considerably more recent than the estimated divergence times. We uncovered multiple cases of past gene flow that contradict a bifurcating species tree.

	abstract = {Genome duplication with hybridization, or allopolyploidization, occurs commonly in plants, and is considered to be a strong force for generating new species. However, genome-wide quantification of homeolog expression ratios was technically hindered because of the high homology between homeologous gene pairs. To quantify the homeolog expression ratio using {RNA}-seq obtained from polyploids, a new method named {HomeoRoq} was developed, in which the genomic origin of sequencing reads was estimated using mismatches between the read and each parental genome. To verify this method, we first assembled the two diploid parental genomes of Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera and Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. petraea (Arabidopsis petraea subsp. umbrosa), then generated a synthetic allotetraploid, mimicking the natural allopolyploid Arabidopsis kamchatica. The quantified ratios corresponded well to those obtained by Pyrosequencing. We found that the ratios of homeologs before and after cold stress treatment were highly correlated (r = 0.870). This highlights the presence of nonstochastic polyploid gene regulation despite previous research identifying stochastic variation in expression. Moreover, our new statistical test incorporating overdispersion identified 226 homeologs (1.11\% of 20 369 expressed homeologs) with significant ratio changes, many of which were related to stress responses. {HomeoRoq} would contribute to the study of the genes responsible for polyploid-specific environmental responses.},

Of these {SNPs}, 12,712 high-confidence {SNPs} were subjected to high-throughput genotyping and assigned to 24 consensus linkage groups ({LGs}). The total length of the genetic linkage map was 3,497.29 {cM} with an average distance of 0.47 {cM} between loci, thereby representing the densest genetic map currently reported for Japanese flounder. Nine positive quantitative trait loci ({QTLs}) forming two main clusters for Vibrio anguillarum disease resistance were detected. All {QTLs} could explain 5.1–8.38\% of the total phenotypic variation. Synteny analysis of the {QTL} regions on the genome assembly revealed 12 immune-related genes, among them 4 genes strongly associated with V. anguillarum disease resistance. In addition, 246 genome assembly scaffolds with an average size of 21.79 Mb were anchored onto the {LGs}; these scaffolds, comprising 522.99 Mb, represented 95.78\% of assembled genomic sequences. The mapped assembly scaffolds in Japanese flounder were used for genome synteny analyses against zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes). Flounder and medaka were found to possess almost one-to-one synteny, whereas flounder and zebrafish exhibited a multi-syntenic correspondence. The newly developed high-resolution genetic map, which will facilitate {QTL} mapping, scaffold assembly, and genome synteny analysis of Japanese flounder, marks a milestone in the ongoing genome project for this species.},

The linkage map contains 9164 {SNP} markers covering 1832.9 {cM}. 1232 bins account for 7648 of the markers. A subset of 2795 {SNP} markers, with an average distance of 0.66 {cM} between adjacent markers, was applied for {QTL} mapping of seed colour and the cell wall fiber components acid detergent lignin ({ADL}), cellulose and hemicellulose. After phenotypic analyses across four different environments a total of 11 {QTL} were detected for seed colour and fiber traits. The high-density map considerably improved {QTL} resolution compared to the previous low-density maps. A previously identified major {QTL} with very high effects on seed colour and {ADL} was pinpointed to a narrow genome interval on chromosome A09, while a minor {QTL} explaining 8.1\% to 14.1\% of variation for {ADL} was detected on chromosome C05. Five and three {QTL} accounting for 4.7\% to 21.9\% and 7.3\% to 16.9\% of the phenotypic variation for cellulose and hemicellulose, respectively, were also detected. To our knowledge this is the first description of {QTL} for seed cellulose and hemicellulose in B. napus, representing interesting new targets for improving oil content. The high density {SNP} genetic map enables navigation from interesting B. napus {QTL} to Brassica genome sequences, giving useful new information for understanding the genetics of key seed quality traits in rapeseed.},

	abstract = {Polyploidy plays a crucial role in plant evolution. Brassica napus (2n = 38, {AACC}), the most important oil crop in the Brassica genus, is an allotetraploid that originated through natural doubling of chromosomes after the hybridization of its progenitor species, B. rapa (2n = 20, {AA}) and B. oleracea (2n = 18, {CC}). A better understanding of the evolutionary relationship between B. napus and B. rapa, B. oleracea, as well as Arabidopsis, which has a common ancestor with these three species, will provide valuable information about the generation and evolution of allopolyploidy. Based on a high-density genetic map with single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) and simple sequence repeat ({SSR}) markers, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of B. napus with Arabidopsis and its progenitor species B. rapa and B. oleracea. Based on the collinear relationship of B. rapa and B. oleracea in the B. napus genetic map, the B. napus genome was found to consist of 70.1\% of the skeleton components of the chromosomes of B. rapa and B. oleracea, with 17.7\% of sequences derived from reciprocal translocation between homoeologous chromosomes between the A- and C-genome and 3.6\% of sequences derived from reciprocal translocation between non-homologous chromosomes at both intra- and inter-genomic levels. The current study thus provides insights into the formation and evolution of the allotetraploid B. napus genome, which will allow for more accurate transfer of genomic information from B. rapa, B. oleracea and Arabidopsis to B. napus.},

Analysing genome sequences of the two parents, 1,323 {SSR}, 3,838 insertion/deletion ({InDel}), and 9,366 single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) primer pairs were developed. All of the {SSRs}, 121 {InDels}, 441 {SNPs}, and other 6,747 primer pairs were screened in the two parents, and a total of 535 new polymorphic loci were identified. A genetic map including 1,013 loci was constructed using these results and 506 loci previously published for this population. Twenty-seven new {QTLs} for yield and fibre quality were identified, indicating that the efficiency of {QTL} detection was greatly improved by the increase in map density. Comparative genomics showed there to be considerable homology and collinearity between the {AT} and A2 genomes and between the {DT} and D5 genomes, although there were a few exchanges and introgressions among the chromosomes of the A2 genome.

Numerous approaches for genome complexity reduction have been developed using different combinations of restriction enzymes, library construction strategies and fragment size selection.

We developed {SimRAD}, an R package that performs in silico restriction enzyme digests and fragment size selection as implemented in most restriction site associated {DNA} polymorphism and genotyping by sequencing methods. In silico digestion is performed on a reference genome or on a randomly generated {DNA} sequence when no reference genome sequence is available. {SimRAD} accurately predicts the number of loci under alternative protocols when a reference genome sequence is available for the targeted species (or a close relative) but may be unreliable when no reference genome is available. {SimRAD} is also useful for fine-tuning a given protocol to adjust the number of targeted loci.

	abstract = {Summary
Alternative splicing ({AS}) of pre-{mRNA} represents a major mechanism underlying increased transcriptome and proteome complexity. Here, we show that the nuclear speckle {RNA}-binding protein ({NSR}) and the {AS} competitor long noncoding {RNA} (or {ASCO}-{lncRNA}) constitute an {AS} regulatory module. {AtNSR}-{GFP} translational fusions are expressed in primary and lateral root ({LR}) meristems. Double Atnsr mutants and {ASCO} overexpressors exhibit an altered ability to form {LRs} after auxin treatment. Interestingly, auxin induces a major change in {AS} patterns of many genes, a response largely dependent on {NSRs}. {RNA} immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that {AtNSRs} interact not only with their alternatively spliced {mRNA} targets but also with the {ASCO}-{RNA} in vivo. The {ASCO}-{RNA} displaces an {AS} target from an {NSR}-containing complex in vitro. Expression of {ASCO}-{RNA} in Arabidopsis affects the splicing patterns of several {NSR}-regulated {mRNA} targets. Hence, {lncRNA} can hijack nuclear {AS} regulators to modulate {AS} patterns during development.},

Emerging work has found that many {lncRNAs} regulate gene expression and can affect genome stability and nuclear domain organization both in plant and in the animal kingdom. Here, we describe the major plant {lncRNAs} and how they act, with a focus on research in Arabidopsis thaliana and our emerging understanding of {lncRNA} functions in serving as molecular sponges and decoys, functioning in regulation of transcription and silencing, particularly in {RNA}-directed {DNA} methylation, and in epigenetic regulation of flowering time.},

Herein, we describe step by step the deoxy-{UTP} ({dUTP}) strand-marking protocol [Parkhomchuk, D., Borodina, T., Amstislavskiy, V., Banaru, M., Hallen, L., Krobitsch, S., Lehrach, H., Soldatov, A.

Methods7(9), 709–715]. The procedure starts with the isolation of the {polyA} fraction ({mRNA}) within a pool of total {RNA}, followed by its fragmentation. Then double-stranded (ds) {cDNA} synthesis is performed with the incorporation of {dUTP} in the second strand. The ds {cDNA} fragments are further processed following a standard sequencing library preparation scheme tailored for the Illumina sequencing platform: end polishing, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and size selection. Prior to final amplification, the {dUTP}-marked strand is selectively degraded by Uracil-{DNA}-Glycosylase ({UDG}). The remaining strand is amplified to generate a {cDNA} library suitable for sequencing.},

More importantly, these next-generation sequencing studies can be performed in organisms for which few genomic resources presently exist. To speed this revolution in evolutionary genetics, we have developed Restriction site Associated {DNA} ({RAD}) genotyping, a method that uses Illumina next-generation sequencing to simultaneously discover and score tens to hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) markers in hundreds of individuals for minimal investment of resources. In this chapter, we describe the core {RAD}-seq protocol, which can be modified to suit a diversity of evolutionary genetic questions. In addition, we discuss bioinformatic considerations that arise from unique aspects of next-generation sequencing data as compared to traditional marker-based approaches, and we outline some general analytical approaches for {RAD}-seq and similar data. Despite considerable progress, the development of analytical tools remains in its infancy, and further work is needed to fully quantify sampling variance and biases in these data types.},

	abstract = {Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial grass that has been designated as an herbaceous model biofuel crop for the United States of America. To facilitate accelerated breeding programs of switchgrass, we developed both an association panel and linkage populations for genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) and genomic selection ({GS}). All of the 840 individuals were then genotyped using genotyping by sequencing ({GBS}), generating 350 {GB} of sequence in total. As a highly heterozygous polyploid (tetraploid and octoploid) species lacking a reference genome, switchgrass is highly intractable with earlier methodologies of single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) discovery. To access the genetic diversity of species like switchgrass, we developed a {SNP} discovery pipeline based on a network approach called the Universal Network-Enabled Analysis Kit ({UNEAK}). Complexities that hinder single nucleotide polymorphism discovery, such as repeats, paralogs, and sequencing errors, are easily resolved with {UNEAK}. Here, 1.2 million putative {SNPs} were discovered in a diverse collection of primarily upland, northern-adapted switchgrass populations. Further analysis of this data set revealed the fundamentally diploid nature of tetraploid switchgrass. Taking advantage of the high conservation of genome structure between switchgrass and foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.), two parent-specific, synteny-based, ultra high-density linkage maps containing a total of 88,217 {SNPs} were constructed. Also, our results showed clear patterns of isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-ploidy in natural populations of switchgrass. Phylogenetic analysis supported a general south-to-north migration path of switchgrass. In addition, this analysis suggested that upland tetraploid arose from upland octoploid. All together, this study provides unparalleled insights into the diversity, genomic complexity, population structure, phylogeny, phylogeography, ploidy, and evolutionary dynamics of switchgrass., Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled large-scale surveys of genetic diversity in model species with a wholly or partly sequenced reference genome. However, thousands of key species, which are essential for food, health, energy, and ecology, do not have reference genomes. To accelerate their breeding cycle via marker assisted selection, high-throughput genotyping is required for these valuable species, in spite of the absence of reference genomes. Based on genotyping by sequencing ({GBS}) technology, we developed a new single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) discovery protocol, the Universal Network-Enabled Analysis Kit ({UNEAK}), which can be widely used in any species, regardless of genome complexity or the availability of a reference genome. Here we test this protocol on switchgrass, currently the prime energy crop species in the United States of America. In addition to the discovery of over a million {SNPs} and construction of high-density linkage maps, we provide novel insights into the genome complexity, ploidy, phylogeny, and evolution of switchgrass. This is only the beginning: we believe {UNEAK} offers the key to the exploration and exploitation of the genetic diversity of thousands of non-model species.},

	abstract = {Background
Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) technologies have accelerated considerably the investigation into the composition of genomes and their functions. Genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) is a genotyping approach that makes use of {NGS} to rapidly and economically scan a genome. It has been shown to allow the simultaneous discovery and genotyping of thousands to millions of {SNPs} across a wide range of species. For most users, the main challenge in {GBS} is the bioinformatics analysis of the large amount of sequence information derived from sequencing {GBS} libraries in view of calling alleles at {SNP} loci. Herein we describe a new {GBS} bioinformatics pipeline, Fast-{GBS}, designed to provide highly accurate genotyping, to require modest computing resources and to offer ease of use.

Results
Fast-{GBS} is built upon standard bioinformatics language and file formats, is capable of handling data from different sequencing platforms, is capable of detecting different kinds of variants ({SNPs}, {MNPs}, and Indels). To illustrate its performance, we called variants in three collections of samples (soybean, barley, and potato) that cover a range of different genome sizes, levels of genome complexity, and ploidy. Within these small sets of samples, we called 35 k, 32 k and 38 k {SNPs} for soybean, barley and potato, respectively. To assess genotype accuracy, we compared these {GBS}-derived {SNP} genotypes with independent data sets obtained from whole-genome sequencing or {SNP} arrays. This analysis yielded estimated accuracies of 98.7, 95.2, and 94\% for soybean, barley, and potato, respectively.

Conclusions
We conclude that Fast-{GBS} provides a highly efficient and reliable tool for calling {SNPs} from {GBS} data.},

Herein we describe a bioinformatics pipeline, tassel-gbs, designed for the efficient processing of raw {GBS} sequence data into {SNP} genotypes. The tassel-gbs pipeline successfully fulfills the following key design criteria: (1) Ability to run on the modest computing resources that are typically available to small breeding or ecological research programs, including desktop or laptop machines with only 8–16 {GB} of {RAM}, (2) Scalability from small to extremely large studies, where hundreds of thousands or even millions of {SNPs} can be scored in up to 100,000 individuals (e.g., for large breeding programs or genetic surveys), and (3) Applicability in an accelerated breeding context, requiring rapid turnover from tissue collection to genotypes. Although a reference genome is required, the pipeline can also be run with an unfinished “pseudo-reference” consisting of numerous contigs. We describe the tassel-gbs pipeline in detail and benchmark it based upon a large scale, species wide analysis in maize (Zea mays), where the average error rate was reduced to 0.0042 through application of population genetic-based {SNP} filters. Overall, the {GBS} assay and the tassel-gbs pipeline provide robust tools for studying genomic diversity.},

	shorttitle = {{GBS}-{SNP}-{CROP}},
	abstract = {Background
With its simple library preparation and robust approach to genome reduction, genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) is a flexible and cost-effective strategy for {SNP} discovery and genotyping, provided an appropriate reference genome is available. For resource-limited curation, research, and breeding programs of underutilized plant genetic resources, however, even low-depth references may not be within reach, despite declining sequencing costs. Such programs would find value in an open-source bioinformatics pipeline that can maximize {GBS} data usage and perform high-density {SNP} genotyping in the absence of a reference.

Results
The {GBS} {SNP}-Calling Reference Optional Pipeline ({GBS}-{SNP}-{CROP}) developed and presented here adopts a clustering strategy to build a population-tailored “Mock Reference” from the same {GBS} data used for downstream {SNP} calling and genotyping. Designed for libraries of paired-end ({PE}) reads, {GBS}-{SNP}-{CROP} maximizes data usage by eliminating unnecessary data culling due to imposed read-length uniformity requirements. Using 150 bp {PE} reads from a {GBS} library of 48 accessions of tetraploid kiwiberry (Actinidia arguta), {GBS}-{SNP}-{CROP} yielded on average three times as many {SNPs} as {TASSEL}-{GBS} analyses (32 and 64 bp tag lengths) and over 18 times as many as {TASSEL}-{UNEAK}, with fewer genotyping errors in all cases, as evidenced by comparing the genotypic characterizations of biological replicates. Using the published reference genome of a related diploid species (A. chinensis), the reference-based version of {GBS}-{SNP}-{CROP} behaved similarly to {TASSEL}-{GBS} in terms of the number of {SNPs} called but had an improved read depth distribution and fewer genotyping errors. Our results also indicate that the sets of {SNPs} detected by the different pipelines above are largely orthogonal to one another; thus {GBS}-{SNP}-{CROP} may be used to augment the results of alternative analyses, whether or not a reference is available.

Conclusions
By achieving high-density {SNP} genotyping in populations for which no reference genome is available, {GBS}-{SNP}-{CROP} is worth consideration by curators, researchers, and breeders of under-researched plant genetic resources. In cases where a reference is available, especially if from a related species or when the target population is particularly diverse, {GBS}-{SNP}-{CROP} may complement other reference-based pipelines by extracting more information per sequencing dollar spent.

	abstract = {Amorphophallus paeoniifolius, is a commercially important vegetable crop because of its high production potential. In this study, we generated a total of 166 Gb of genomic data from 16 wild and 20 cultivated A. paeoniifolius individuals in southwestern China using restriction site associated {DNA} sequencing ({RAD}-seq). We compared the genome-wide variations between the wild and cultivated populations. Wild populations exhibited higher genetic diversity than did cultivated populations based on private allele number, expected heterozygosity, observed heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity. {STRUCTURE} analysis, principal component analysis ({PCA}) and a maximum likelihood ({ML}) tree indicated that A. paeoniifolius populations could be divided into three groups (a cultivated group and two wild groups) with significant genetic differentiation. The low genetic diversity and shallow genetic differentiation found within cultivated populations are likely caused by continuous selection and the clonal propagation methods used during domestication. The significant differentiation between the wild populations may suggest strong genetic drift due to small populations and human disturbance. The genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) identified in our study will provide a valuable resource for further breeding improvement and effective use of the germplasm.},

However, a perceived limitation of these ultra-high-throughput technologies is their short read-lengths. De novo assembly of sequence reads generated by classical Sanger capillary sequencing is a mature field of research. Unfortunately, the existing sequence assembly programs were not effective for short sequence reads generated by Illumina and {SOLiD} platforms. Early studies suggested that, in principle, sequence reads as short as 20–30 nucleotides could be used to generate useful assemblies of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome sequences, albeit containing many gaps. The early feasibility studies and proofs of principle inspired several bioinformatics research groups to implement new algorithms as freely available software tools specifically aimed at assembling reads of 30–50 nucleotides in length. This has led to the generation of several draft genome sequences based exclusively on short sequence Illumina sequence reads, recently culminating in the assembly of the 2.25-Gb genome of the giant panda from Illumina sequence reads with an average length of just 52 nucleotides. As well as reviewing recent developments in the field, we discuss some practical aspects such as data filtering and submission of assembly data to public repositories.},

However, compared with the high percentage of hybrid rice planted in the world, little commercial hybrid wheat is planted globally as a result of the lack of a suitable system for male sterility. Therefore, understanding the molecular nature of male fertility in wheat is critical for commercially viable hybrid wheat. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Male Sterility 1 (Ms1) in bread wheat by using a combination of advanced genomic approaches. {MS}1 is a newly evolved gene in the Poaceae that is specifically expressed in microsporocytes, and is essential for microgametogenesis. Orthologs of Ms1 are expressed in diploid and allotetraploid ancestral species. Orthologs of Ms1 are epigenetically silenced in the A and D subgenomes of allohexaploid wheat; only Ms1 from the B subgenome is expressed. The encoded protein, Ms1, is localized to plastid and mitochondrial membranes, where it exhibits phospholipid-binding activity. These findings provide a foundation for the development of commercially viable hybrid wheat.},

	abstract = {New sequencing technology has dramatically altered the landscape of whole-genome sequencing, allowing scientists to initiate numerous projects to decode the genomes of previously unsequenced organisms. The lowest-cost technology can generate deep coverage of most species, including mammals, in just a few days. The sequence data generated by one of these projects consist of millions or billions of short {DNA} sequences (reads) that range from 50 to 150 nt in length. These sequences must then be assembled de novo before most genome analyses can begin. Unfortunately, genome assembly remains a very difficult problem, made more difficult by shorter reads and unreliable long-range linking information. In this study, we evaluated several of the leading de novo assembly algorithms on four different short-read data sets, all generated by Illumina sequencers. Our results describe the relative performance of the different assemblers as well as other significant differences in assembly difficulty that appear to be inherent in the genomes themselves. Three overarching conclusions are apparent: first, that data quality, rather than the assembler itself, has a dramatic effect on the quality of an assembled genome; second, that the degree of contiguity of an assembly varies enormously among different assemblers and different genomes; and third, that the correctness of an assembly also varies widely and is not well correlated with statistics on contiguity. To enable others to replicate our results, all of our data and methods are freely available, as are all assemblers used in this study.},

	abstract = {Variation in life history contributes to reproductive success in different environments. Divergence of annual and perennial angiosperm species is an extreme example that has occurred frequently. Perennials survive for several years and restrict the duration of reproduction by cycling between vegetative growth and flowering, whereas annuals live for 1 year and flower once. We used the tribe Arabideae (Brassicaceae) to study the divergence of seasonal flowering behaviour among annual and perennial species. In perennial Brassicaceae, orthologues of {FLOWERING} {LOCUS} C ({FLC}), a floral inhibitor in Arabidopsis thaliana, are repressed by winter cold and reactivated in spring conferring seasonal flowering patterns, whereas in annuals, they are stably repressed by cold. We isolated {FLC} orthologues from three annual and two perennial Arabis species and found that the duplicated structure of the A. alpina locus is not required for perenniality. The expression patterns of the genes differed between annuals and perennials, as observed among Arabidopsis species, suggesting a broad relevance of these patterns within the Brassicaceae. Also analysis of plants derived from an interspecies cross of A. alpina and annual A. montbretiana demonstrated that cis-regulatory changes in {FLC} orthologues contribute to their different transcriptional patterns. Sequence comparisons of {FLC} orthologues from annuals and perennials in the tribes Arabideae and Camelineae identified two regulatory regions in the first intron whose sequence variation correlates with divergence of the annual and perennial expression patterns. Thus, we propose that related cis-acting changes in {FLC} orthologues occur independently in different tribes of the Brassicaceae during life history evolution.},

	abstract = {Folding to a well-defined conformation is essential for the function of structured ribonucleic acids ({RNAs}) like the ribosome and {tRNA}. Structured elements in the untranslated regions ({UTRs}) of specific messenger {RNAs} ({mRNAs}) are known to control expression. The importance of unstructured regions adopting multiple conformations, however, is still poorly understood. High-resolution {SHAPE}-directed Boltzmann suboptimal sampling of the Homo sapiens Retinoblastoma 1 ({RB}1) 5′ {UTR} yields three distinct conformations compatible with the experimental data. Private single nucleotide variants ({SNVs}) identified in two patients with retinoblastoma each collapse the structural ensemble to a single but distinct well-defined conformation. The {RB}1 5′ {UTRs} from Bos taurus (cow) and Trichechus manatus latirostris (manatee) are divergent in sequence from H. sapiens (human) yet maintain structural compatibility with high-probability base pairs. {SHAPE} chemical probing of the cow and manatee {RB}1 5′ {UTRs} reveals that they also adopt multiple conformations. Luciferase reporter assays reveal that 5′ {UTR} mutations alter {RB}1 expression. In a traditional model of disease, causative {SNVs} disrupt a key structural element in the {RNA}. For the subset of patients with heritable retinoblastoma-associated {SNVs} in the {RB}1 5′ {UTR}, the absence of multiple structures is likely causative of the cancer. Our data therefore suggest that selective pressure will favor multiple conformations in eukaryotic {UTRs} to regulate expression.},

	abstract = {Huge efforts have been invested in the last two decades to dissect the genetic bases of complex traits including yields of many crop plants, through quantitative trait locus ({QTL}) analyses. However, almost all the studies were based on linkage maps constructed using low-throughput molecular markers, e.g. restriction fragment length polymorphisms ({RFLPs}) and simple sequence repeats ({SSRs}), thus are mostly of low density and not able to provide precise and complete information about the numbers and locations of the genes or {QTLs} controlling the traits. In this study, we constructed an ultra-high density genetic map based on high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) from low-coverage sequences of a recombinant inbred line ({RIL}) population of rice, generated using new sequencing technology. The quality of the map was assessed by validating the positions of several cloned genes including {GS}3 and {GW}5/{qSW}5, two major {QTLs} for grain length and grain width respectively, and {OsC}1, a qualitative trait locus for pigmentation. In all the cases the loci could be precisely resolved to the bins where the genes are located, indicating high quality and accuracy of the map. The {SNP} map was used to perform {QTL} analysis for yield and three yield-component traits, number of tillers per plant, number of grains per panicle and grain weight, using data from field trials conducted over years, in comparison to {QTL} mapping based on {RFLPs}/{SSRs}. The {SNP} map detected more {QTLs} especially for grain weight, with precise map locations, demonstrating advantages in detecting power and resolution relative to the {RFLP}/{SSR} map. Thus this study provided an example for ultra-high density map construction using sequencing technology. Moreover, the results obtained are helpful for understanding the genetic bases of the yield traits and for fine mapping and cloning of {QTLs}.},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary history of microbial pathogens is critical for mitigating the impacts of emerging infectious diseases on economically and ecologically important host species. We used a genome resequencing approach to resolve the evolutionary history of an important microbial pathogen, the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which has been implicated in amphibian declines worldwide. We sequenced the genomes of 29 isolates of Bd from around the world, with an emphasis on North, Central, and South America because of the devastating effect that Bd has had on amphibian populations in the New World. We found a substantial amount of evolutionary complexity in Bd with deep phylogenetic diversity that predates observed global amphibian declines. By investigating the entire genome, we found that even the most recently evolved Bd clade (termed the global panzootic lineage) contained more genetic variation than previously reported. We also found dramatic differences among isolates and among genomic regions in chromosomal copy number and patterns of heterozygosity, suggesting complex and heterogeneous genome dynamics. Finally, we report evidence for selection acting on the Bd genome, supporting the hypothesis that protease genes are important in evolutionary transitions in this group. Bd is considered an emerging pathogen because of its recent effects on amphibians, but our data indicate that it has a complex evolutionary history that predates recent disease outbreaks. Therefore, it is important to consider the contemporary effects of Bd in a broader evolutionary context and identify specific mechanisms that may have led to shifts in virulence in this system.},

However, this legume is less investigated because of its sparse genomic resources and very slow breeding process. In this study, 570 million quality-filtered and trimmed {cDNA} sequence reads with total length of over 82 billion bp were obtained using the Illumina {NextSeqTM} 500 platform. Approximately two million contigs and 142,053 transcripts were assembled from our {RNA}-Seq data, which resulted in 27,431 unigenes with an average length of 1,250 bp and maximum length of 48,515 bp. The unigenes were of high-quality. For example, the stay-green ({SGR}) gene of grasspea was aligned with the {SGR} gene of pea with high similarity. Among these unigenes, 3,204 {EST}-{SSR} primers were designed, 284 of which were randomly chosen for validation. Of these validated unigenes, 87 (30.6\%) {EST}-{SSR} primers produced polymorphic amplicons among 43 grasspea accessions selected from different geographical locations. Meanwhile, 146,406 {SNPs} were screened and 50 {SNP} loci were randomly chosen for the kompetitive allele-specific {PCR} ({KASP}) validation. Over 80\% (42) {SNP} loci were successfully transformed to {KASP} markers. Comparison of the dendrograms according to the {SSR} and {KASP} markers showed that the different marker systems are partially consistent with the dendrogram constructed in our study.},

To address this limitation, we developed {ABySS} (Assembly By Short Sequences), a parallelized sequence assembler. As a demonstration of the capability of our software, we assembled 3.5 billion paired-end reads from the genome of an African male publicly released by Illumina, Inc. Approximately 2.76 million contigs ≥100 base pairs (bp) in length were created with an N50 size of 1499 bp, representing 68\% of the reference human genome. Analysis of these contigs identified polymorphic and novel sequences not present in the human reference assembly, which were validated by alignment to alternate human assemblies and to other primate genomes.},

To date, the genome assemblies generated from such data have fallen far short of those obtained with the older (but much more expensive) capillary-based sequencing approach. Here, we report the development of an algorithm for genome assembly, {ALLPATHS}-{LG}, and its application to massively parallel {DNA} sequence data from the human and mouse genomes, generated on the Illumina platform. The resulting draft genome assemblies have good accuracy, short-range contiguity, long-range connectivity, and coverage of the genome. In particular, the base accuracy is high (≥99.95\%) and the scaffold sizes (N50 size = 11.5 Mb for human and 7.2 Mb for mouse) approach those obtained with capillary-based sequencing. The combination of improved sequencing technology and improved computational methods should now make it possible to increase dramatically the de novo sequencing of large genomes.

Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads \&gt;200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as {BLAT} and {SSAHA}2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time.Results: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment ({BWA}-{SW}), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as {SSAHA}2, more accurate than {BLAT}, and is several to tens of times faster than both.Availability:http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.{netContact}:rd@sanger.ac.uk},

One of the key applications of next-generation sequencing is studying genetic variation between individuals using whole-genome or target region resequencing. Here, we have developed a consensus-calling and {SNP}-detection method for sequencing-by-synthesis Illumina Genome Analyzer technology. We designed this method by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and experimental errors common to this technology. All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. We tested this methodology using a large-scale human resequencing data set of 36× coverage and assembled a high-quality nonrepetitive consensus sequence for 92.25\% of the diploid autosomes and 88.07\% of the haploid X chromosome. Comparison of the consensus sequence with Illumina human 1M {BeadChip} genotyped alleles from the same {DNA} sample showed that 98.6\% of the 37,933 genotyped alleles on the X chromosome and 98\% of 999,981 genotyped alleles on autosomes were covered at 99.97\% and 99.84\% consistency, respectively. At a low sequencing depth, we used prior probability of {dbSNP} alleles and were able to improve coverage of the {dbSNP} sites significantly as compared to that obtained using a nonimputation model. Our analyses demonstrate that our method has a very low false call rate at any sequencing depth and excellent genome coverage at a high sequencing depth.},

However, in applications of the next-generation sequencing ({NGS}), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty.Results: We present a statistical framework for calling {SNPs}, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.Availability:http://samtools.sourceforge.{netContact}:hengli@broadinstitute.org},

New methods allowing rapid, high-throughput genotyping of entire crop populations have proliferated and opened the door to wider use of molecular tools in plant breeding. These new genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) methods include over a dozen reduced-representation sequencing ({RRS}) approaches and at least four whole-genome resequencing ({WGR}) approaches. The diversity of methods available, each often producing different types of data at different cost, can make selection of the best-suited method seem a daunting task. We review the most common genotyping methods used today and compare their suitability for linkage mapping, genomewide association studies ({GWAS}), marker-assisted and genomic selection and genome assembly and improvement in crops with various genome sizes and complexity. Furthermore, we give an outline of bioinformatics tools for analysis of genotyping data. {WGR} is well suited to genotyping biparental cross populations with complex, small- to moderate-sized genomes and provides the lowest cost per marker data point. {RRS} approaches differ in their suitability for various tasks, but demonstrate similar costs per marker data point. These approaches are generally better suited for de novo applications and more cost-effective when genotyping populations with large genomes or high heterozygosity. We expect that although {RRS} approaches will remain the most cost-effective for some time, {WGR} will become more widespread for crop genotyping as sequencing costs continue to decrease.},

This approach is particularly amenable to crop species because it minimizes the number of genetic crosses (n = 1 or 0) and mutant F-2 progeny that are required. We applied {MutMap} to seven mutants of a Japanese elite rice cultivar and identified the unique genomic positions most probable to harbor mutations causing pale green leaves and semidwarfism, an agronomically relevant trait.

It then uses this information to objectively localize the candidate mutation based on its exclusive segregation with the mutant parental line. A user-friendly, web-based tool for performing {NGM} analysis is available at http://bar.utoronto.ca/{NGM}.

We demonstrated that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by identifying recombinant breakpoints in F(2) individuals. Barcoding also facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by in silico re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the {RAD} sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced mutation in Neurospora crassa. Sequencing of {RAD} markers is an integrated platform for {SNP} discovery and genotyping. This approach should be widely applicable to genetic mapping in a variety of organisms.},

This can reduce genotyping costs of marker-{QTL} linkage determination by up to two orders of magnitude. Theoretical analysis of selective {DNA} pooling shows that for experiments involving backcross, F-2 and half-sib designs, the power of selective {DNA} pooling for detecting genes with large effect, can be the same as that obtained by individual selective genotyping. Power for detecting genes with small effect, however, was found to decrease strongly with increase in the technical error of estimating allele frequencies in the pooled samples. The effect of technical error, however, can be markedly reduced by replication of technical procedures. It is also shown that a proportion selected of 0.1 at each tail will be appropriate for a wide range of experimental conditions.},

Studies in both humans and model organisms, such as yeast, have failed to detect a large fraction of the loci that underlie such complex traits(2,3). A lack of statistical power to identify multiple loci with small effects is undoubtedly one of the primary reasons for this problem. We have developed a method in yeast that allows the use of much larger sample sizes than previously possible and hence permits the detection of multiple loci with small effects. The method involves generating very large numbers of progeny from a cross between two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and then phenotyping and genotyping pools of these offspring. We applied the method to 17 chemical resistance traits and mitochondrial function, and identified loci for each of these phenotypes. We show that the level of genetic complexity underlying these quantitative traits is highly variable, with some traits influenced by one major locus and others by at least 20 loci. Our results provide an empirical demonstration of the genetic complexity of a number of traits and show that it is possible to identify many of the underlying factors using straightforward techniques. Our method should have broad applications in yeast and can be extended to other organisms.},

	abstract = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of {DNA} sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing {GBS} libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes ({REs}). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive {REs}, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The {GBS} procedure is demonstrated with maize ({IBM}) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of {GBS} to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks. (Pt), is a broadly distributed and economically important disease of wheat. Deploying cultivars carrying effective leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes is a desirable method of disease control. {KU}3198 is a common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) accession from the Kyoto collection that was highly resistant to Pt in Canada. An F-2 population from the cross {HY}644/{KU}3198 showed segregation for two dominant Lr genes when tested with Pt race {MBDS} which was virulent on {HY}644. Multiple bulk segregant analysis ({MBSA}) was employed to find putative chromosome locations of these Lr genes using {SSR} markers that provided coverage of the genome. {MBSA} predicted that the Lr genes were located on chromosomes 5B and 5D. A doubled haploid population was generated from the cross of {JBT}05-714 ({HY}644*3/{KU}3198), a line carrying one of the Lr genes from {KU}3198, to Thatcher. This population segregated for a single Lr gene conferring resistance to Pt race {MBDS}, which was mapped to the terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 5B with {SSR} markers and given the temporary designation {LrK}1. One F-3 family derived from the {HY}644/{KU}3198 F-2 population that segregated only for the second Lr gene from {KU}3198 was identified. This family was treated as an F-2-equivalent population and used for mapping the Lr gene, which was located to the terminal region of chromosome 5DS. As no other Lr gene has been mapped to 5DS, this gene is novel and has been designated as Lr70.},

Here, we report a comprehensive assessment of the evolution of modern maize based on the genome-wide resequencing of 75 wild, landrace and improved maize lines(3).

We identify a number of genes with stronger signals of selection than those previously shown to underlie major morphological changes(4,5).

This observation suggests that some progeny should be more useful for {QTL} mapping than others. The marker genotypes of the progeny should allow the number of recombination events they carry to be determined such that the most useful progeny could be phenotyped, in a procedure termed selective phenotyping. Two methods to select genotypes for their usefulness in mapping are described, one that maximizes the overall mapping information content in the selected progeny, and one that seeks to maximize both overall mapping information and the uniformity of its distribution across the genome. Simulations showed that both methods successfully decreased the mean squared error ({MSE}) for {QTL} position. Average {MSEs} were similar for the two methods and variability of {MSE} was slightly lower for the latter relative to the former method. Simulations indicated that a large fraction of the decrease in the {MSE} achievable by selective phenotyping could be obtained by genotyping twice the number of progeny than were ultimately phenotyped, though further decreases in the {MSE} were observed when up to},

However, the underlying genetic changes correlated with these gains remain largely unknown. We report here the sequencing of 278 temperate maize inbred lines from different stages of breeding history, including deep resequencing of 4 lines with known pedigree information. The results show that modern breeding has introduced highly dynamic genetic changes into the maize genome. Artificial selection has affected thousands of targets, including genes and non-genic regions, leading to a reduction in nucleotide diversity and an increase in the proportion of rare alleles. Genetic changes during breeding happen rapidly, with extensive variation ({SNPs}, indels and copy-number variants ({CNVs})) occurring, even within identity-by-descent regions. Our genome-wide assessment of genetic changes during modern maize breeding provides new strategies as well as practical targets for future crop breeding and biotechnology.},

	abstract = {The power of a genetic mapping study depends on the heritability of the trait, the number of individuals included in the analysis, and the genetic dissimilarity among them. In experiments that involve microarrays or other complex physiological assays, phenotyping can be expensive and time-consuming and may impose limits on the sample size. A random selection of individuals may not provide sufficient power to detect linkage until a large sample size is reached. We present an algorithm for selecting a subset of individuals solely on the basis of genotype data that can achieve substantial improvements in sensitivity compared to a random sample of the same size. The selective phenotyping method involves preferentially selecting individuals to maximize their genotypic dissimilarity. Selective phenotyping is most effective when prior knowledge of genetic architecture allows us to focus on specific genetic regions. However, it can also provide modest improvements in efficiency when applied on a whole-genome basis. Importantly, selective phenotyping does not reduce the efficiency of mapping as compared to a random sample in regions that are not considered in the selection process. In contrast to selective genotyping, inferences based solely on a selectively phenotyped population of individuals are representative of the whole population. The substantial improvement introduced by selective phenotyping is particularly useful when phenotyping is difficult or costly and thus limits the sample size in a genetic mapping study.},

The use of well-structured recombinant inbred lines in combination with "omics" analysis can help to disentangle the genetic basis of such quantitative traits. This so-called genetical genomics approach can effectively capture both genetic and epistatic interactions. However, to understand how the environment interacts with genomic-encoded information, a better understanding of the perception and processing of environmental signals is needed. In a classical genetical genomics setup, this requires replication of the whole experiment in different environmental conditions. A novel generalized setup overcomes this limitation and includes environmental perturbation within a single experimental design. We developed a dedicated quantitative trait loci mapping procedure to implement this approach and used existing phenotypical data to demonstrate its power. In addition, we studied the genetic regulation of primary metabolism in dry and imbibed Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds. In the metabolome, many changes were observed that were under both environmental and genetic controls and their interaction. This concept offers unique reduction of experimental load with minimal compromise of statistical power and is of great potential in the field of systems genetics, which requires a broad understanding of both plasticity and dynamic regulation.},

Conventional breeding for drought resistance is slow in attaining progress due to poor understanding of genetic control of drought resistance. Molecular markers help in identification of quantitative trait loci ({QTLs}) associated with drought resistance traits and their indirect selection using marker assisted selection. But {QTL} mapping requires genotyping of large mapping progenies demanding time and labour. Bulked segregant analysis ({BSA}) serves as an alternative approach for rapid identification of markers associated with drought resistance traits. {BSA} was carried out to identify markers linked to drought resistance using 23 recombinant inbred ({RI}) lines of {IR}20/Nootripathu, two indica ecotypes with extreme drought response. The parents were screened for polymorphism using 1206 rice microsatellite primer pairs. Out of 134 {SSR} polymorphic primers between parents, three primers showed polymorphism between bulks. These three primers co-segregated among the individual {RI} lines constituting the respective bulks. The genomic regions flanked by these markers have been reported to be associated with several drought resistance component traits and will be useful in marker assisted breeding for drought resistance in rice.},

Many of these small molecules become covalently attached to proteins. To display these small molecule targets in plants, we introduce a two-step labelling method for minitagged small molecules. Minitags are small chemical moieties (azide or alkyne) that are inert under biological conditions and have little influence on the membrane permeability and specificity of the small molecule. After labelling, proteomes are extracted under denaturing conditions and minitagged proteins are coupled to reporter tags through a 'click chemistry' reaction. We introduce this two-step labelling procedure in plants by studying the well-characterized targets of E-64, a small molecule cysteine protease inhibitor. In contrast to biotinylated E-64, minitagged E-64 efficiently labels vacuolar proteases in vivo. We displayed, purified and identified targets of a minitagged inhibitor that targets the proteasome and cysteine proteases in living plant cells. Chemical interference assays with inhibitors showed that {MG}132, a frequently used proteasome inhibitor, preferentially inhibits cysteine proteases in vivo. The two-step labelling procedure can be applied on detached leaves, cell cultures, seedlings and other living plant tissues and, when combined with photoreactive groups, can be used to identify targets of herbicides, phytohormones and reactive small molecules selected from chemical genetic screens.},

	abstract = {Most common hereditary diseases in humans are complex and multifactorial. Large-scale genome-wide association studies based on {SNP} genotyping have only identified a small fraction of the heritable variation of these diseases. One explanation may be that many rare variants (a minor allele frequency, {MAF} {\textless}5\%), which are not included in the common genotyping platforms, may contribute substantially to the genetic variation of these diseases. Next-generation sequencing, which would allow the analysis of rare variants, is now becoming so cheap that it provides a viable alternative to {SNP} genotyping. In this paper, we present cost-effective protocols for using next-generation sequencing in association mapping studies based on pooled and un-pooled samples, and identify optimal designs with respect to total number of individuals, number of individuals per pool, and the sequencing coverage. We perform a small empirical study to evaluate the pooling variance in a realistic setting where pooling is combined with exon-capturing. To test for associations, we develop a likelihood ratio statistic that accounts for the high error rate of next-generation sequencing data. We also perform extensive simulations to determine the power and accuracy of this method. Overall, our findings suggest that with a fixed cost, sequencing many individuals at a more shallow depth with larger pool size achieves higher power than sequencing a small number of individuals in higher depth with smaller pool size, even in the presence of high error rates. Our results provide guidelines for researchers who are developing association mapping studies based on next-generation sequencing. Genet. Epidemiol. 34 : 479-491, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To identify candidate genes of the restorer-of-fertility gene (Ms) responsible for fertility restoration of onion cytoplasmic male-sterility, a combined approach of bulked segregant analysis and {RNA}-seq was employed. From 32,674 de novo assembled contigs, 430 perfectly homozygous {SNPs} between male-fertile ({MF}) and male-sterile ({MS}) bulks were identified in 141 contigs. After verifying the homozygosity of the {SNPs} by {PCR} amplification and sequencing, the {SNPs} on 139 of the contigs were genotypes for the two recombinants which contained crossover events between the Ms locus and two tightly linked molecular markers. As a result, 30 contigs showing perfect linkage with the Ms locus in the large-sized segregating population were identified. Among them, 14 showed perfect linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) with the Ms locus, as determined by genotyping 251 domestic breeding lines. Furthermore, molecular markers tagging the 14 contigs also showed almost perfect {LD} with each other in 124 exotic accessions introduced from 21 countries, except for one accession which contained a crossover event by which the 14 markers were divided into two groups. After sequencing of the full-length {cDNA} of the 14 contigs showing perfect {LD}, the deduced amino acids sequences of the {MF} and {MS} alleles were compared. Four genes were shown to harbor putative critical amino acid changes in the known domains.

Most studies have employed either simple synthetic populations with restricted allelic variation or performed association mapping on a sample of naturally occurring haplotypes. Both of these approaches have some limitations, therefore alternative resources for the genetic dissection of complex traits continue to be sought. Here we describe one such alternative, the Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross ({MAGIC}). This approach is expected to improve the precision with which {QTL} can be mapped, improving the outlook for {QTL} cloning. Here, we present the first panel of {MAGIC} lines developed: a set of 527 recombinant inbred lines ({RILs}) descended from a heterogeneous stock of 19 intermated accessions of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These lines and the 19 founders were genotyped with 1,260 single nucleotide polymorphisms and phenotyped for development-related traits. Analytical methods were developed to fine-map quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) in the {MAGIC} lines by reconstructing the genome of each line as a mosaic of the founders. We show by simulation that {QTL} explaining 10\% of the phenotypic variance will be detected in most situations with an average mapping error of about 300 kb, and that if the number of lines were doubled the mapping error would be under 200 kb. We also show how the power to detect a {QTL} and the mapping accuracy vary, depending on {QTL} location. We demonstrate the utility of this new mapping population by mapping several known {QTL} with high precision and by finding novel {QTL} for germination data and bolting time.

Nitric oxide ({NO}) content and {iNOS} levels in the media or {RAW}264.7 cells were measured using the Griess reagent and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. {CHU} treatment inhibited {NO} production and {iNOS} induction elicited by lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}, {TLR}4L) in a concentration-dependent manner. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 productions were also diminished. Peptidoglycans ({TLR}2/6L) and {CpG}-oligodeoxynucleotides ({TLR}9L) from {CHU} inhibited {iNOS} induction, but not poly I:C ({TLR}3L) or loxoribine ({TLF}7L). The anti-inflammatory effect resulted from the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B ({NF}-kappa B) through the inhibition of inhibitory-kappa B degradation. Of the representative components in {CHU}, specific oligopeptides ({AFPG} and {GVAWWMY}) had the ability to inhibit {iNOS} induction by {LPS}, whereas others failed to do so. Daidzein, an isoflavone used for comparative purposes, was active at a relatively higher concentration. In an animal model, oral administration of {CHU} to rats significantly diminished carrageenan-induced paw edema and {iNOS} induction. Our results demonstrate that {CHU} has anti-inflammatory effects against {TLR} ligands by inhibiting {NF}-kappa B activation, which may result from specific oligopeptide components in {CHU}. Since {CHU} is orally effective, dietary applications of {CHU} and/or the identified oligopeptides may be of use in the prevention of inflammatory diseases.},

	abstract = {Bulked segregant analysis ({BSA}) using Affymetrix {GeneChips} revealed candidate genes underlying the major {QTL} for Phytophthora capsici resistance in Capsicum . Using the candidate genes, reliable markers for Phytophthora resistance were developed and validated. Phytophthora capsici L. is one of the most destructive pathogens of pepper (Capsicum spp.). Resistance of pepper against P. capsici is controlled by quantitative trait loci ({QTL}), including a major {QTL} on chromosome 5 that is the predominant contributor to resistance. Here, to maximize the effect of this {QTL} and study its underlying genes, an F-2 population and recombinant inbred lines were inoculated with P. capsici strain {JHAI}1-7 zoospores at a low concentration (3 x 10(3)/{mL}). Resistance phenotype segregation ratios for the populations fit a 3:1 and 1:1 (resistant:susceptible) segregation model, respectively, consistent with a single dominant gene model. Bulked segregant analysis ({BSA}) using Affymetrix {GeneChips} revealed a single position polymorphism ({SPP}) marker mapping to the major {QTL}. When this {SPP} marker (Phyto5SAR) together with other {SNP} markers located on chromosome 5 was used to confirm the position of the major {QTL}, Phyto5SAR showed the highest {LOD} value at the {QTL}. A scaffold sequence (scaffold194) containing Phyto5SAR was identified from the C. annuum genome database. The scaffold contained two putative {NBS}-{LRR} genes and one {SAR} 8.2A gene as candidates for contributing to P. capsici resistance. Markers linked to these genes were developed and validated by testing 100 F-1 commercial cultivars. Among the markers, Phyto5NBS1 showed about 90 \% accuracy in predicting resistance phenotypes to a low-virulence P. capsici isolate. These results suggest that Phyto5NBS1 is a reliable marker for P. capsici resistance and can be used for identification of a gene(s) underlying the major {QTL} on chromosome 5.},

	abstract = {Background: Sunflower belongs to the largest plant family on earth, the genomically poorly explored Compositae. Downy mildew Plasmopara halstedii (Farlow) Berlese \& de Toni is one of the major diseases of cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). In the search for new sources of downy mildew resistance, the locus Pl({ARG}) on linkage group 1 ({LG}1) originating from H. argophyllus is promising since it confers resistance against all known races of the pathogen. However, the mapping resolution in the Pl({ARG}) region is hampered by significantly suppressed recombination and by limited availability of polymorphic markers. Here we examined a strategy developed for the enrichment of molecular markers linked to this specific genomic region. We combined bulked segregant analysis ({BSA}) with next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) and de novo assembly of the sunflower transcriptome for single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) discovery in a sequence resource combining reads originating from two sunflower species, H. annuus and H. argophyllus. Results: A computational pipeline developed for {SNP} calling and pattern detection identified 219 candidate genes. For a proof of concept, 42 resistance gene-like sequences were subjected to experimental {SNP} validation. Using a high-resolution mapping population, 12 {SNP} markers were mapped to {LG}1. We successfully verified candidate sequences either co-segregating with or closely flanking Pl({ARG}). Conclusions: This study is the first successful example to improve bulked segregant analysis with de novo transcriptome assembly using next generation sequencing. The {BSTA} pipeline we developed provides a useful guide for similar studies in other non-model organisms. Our results demonstrate this method is an efficient way to enrich molecular markers and to identify candidate genes in a specific mapping interval.},

Next-generation sequencing technologies are making it faster and more efficient to establish the association of agronomic traits with molecular markers or candidate genes, which is the requirement for marker-assisted selection in molecular breeding. Early flowering is an important agronomic trait in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), but the underlying genetic mechanism is unknown. In this study, we identified a candidate gene for early flowering {QTL}, Ef1.1 through {QTL}-seq. Segregation analysis in F-2 and {BC}1 populations derived from a cross between two inbred lines "Muromskij" (early flowering) and "9930" (late flowering) suggested quantitative nature of flowering time in cucumber. Genome-wide comparison of {SNP} profiles between the early and late-flowering bulks constructed from F-2 plants identified a major {QTL}, designated Ef1.1 on cucumber chromosome 1 for early flowering in Muromskij, which was confirmed by microsatellite marker-based classical {QTL} mapping in the F-2 population. Joint {QTL}-seq and traditional {QTL} analysis delimited Ef1.1 to an 890 kb genomic region. A cucumber gene, Csa1G651710, was identified in this region, which is a homolog of the {FLOWERING} {LOCUS} T ({FT}), the main flowering switch gene in Arabidopsis. Quantitative {RT}-{PCR} study of the expression level of Csa1G651710 revealed significantly higher expression in early flowering genotypes. Data presented here provide support for Csa1G651710 as a possible candidate gene for early flowering in the cucumber line Muromskij.},

We compared and contrasted Affymetrix Genechip {HindIII} and Illumina {HumanHap}300 arrays on the same {DNA} pools and showed that the {HumanHap}300 arrays are substantially more efficient. In terms of effective sample size, {HumanHap}300-based pooling extracts 80 of the information available with individual genotyping ({IG}). In contrast, Genechip {HindIII}-based pooling only extracts 30 of the available information. With {HumanHap}300 arrays concordance with {IG} data is excellent. Guidance is given on best study design and it is shown that even after taking into account pooling error, one stage scans can be performed for 100-fold reduced cost compared with {IG}. With appropriately designed two stage studies, {IG} can provide confirmation of pooling results whilst still providing similar to 20-fold reduction in total cost compared with {IG}-based alternatives. The large cost savings with Illumina {HumanHap}300-based pooling imply that future studies need only be limited by the availability of samples and not cost.},

Individuals were genotyped with microsatellites, single nucleotide polymorphisms and four well-known flowering genes ({FRI}, {FLC}, {CRY}2 and {PHYC}). Phenotypic and genotypic data were used to conduct {QSTFST} comparisons. Life-history traits varied significantly among- and within-populations. Flowering time also showed substantial within- and among-population variation as well as significant genotypexenvironment interactions among the various conditions. Individuals bearing {FRI} truncations exhibited reduced recruitment in field conditions and differential flowering time behavior across experimental conditions, suggesting that {FRI} contributes to the observed significant genotypexenvironment interactions. Flowering time estimated in field conditions was the only trait showing significantly higher quantitative genetic differentiation than neutral genetic differentiation values. Overall, our results show that these A.thaliana populations are genetically more differentiated for flowering time than for neutral markers, suggesting that flowering time is likely to be under divergent selection.},

To facilitate gene discovery and molecular breeding in sorghum, we have characterized similar to 265,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) in 971 worldwide accessions that have adapted to diverse agroclimatic conditions. Using this genome-wide {SNP} map, we have characterized population structure with respect to geographic origin and morphological type and identified patterns of ancient crop diffusion to diverse agroclimatic regions across Africa and Asia. To better understand the genomic patterns of diversification in sorghum, we quantified variation in nucleotide diversity, linkage disequilibrium, and recombination rates across the genome. Analyzing nucleotide diversity in landraces, we find evidence of selective sweeps around starch metabolism genes, whereas in landrace-derived introgression lines, we find introgressions around known height and maturity loci. To identify additional loci underlying variation in major agroclimatic traits, we performed genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) on plant height components and inflorescence architecture. {GWAS} maps several classical loci for plant height, candidate genes for inflorescence architecture. Finally, we trace the independent spread of multiple haplotypes carrying alleles for short stature or long inflorescence branches. This genome-wide map of {SNP} variation in sorghum provides a basis for crop improvement through marker-assisted breeding and genomic selection.},

Our results indicate that the transcriptome dynamics are predominantly governed by endogenous diurnal rhythms, ambient temperature, plant age, and solar radiation. The data revealed diurnal gates for environmental stimuli to influence transcription and pointed to relative influences exerted by circadian and environmental factors on different metabolic genes. The model also generated predictions for the influence of changing temperatures on transcriptome dynamics.

Data may be subjected to 'trait-based' analysis, in which marker allele frequencies are compared between classes of progeny defined based on trait values, or to 'marker-based' analysis, in which trait means are compared between progeny classes defined based on marker genotypes. Here, bidirectional and unidirectional selective genotyping were simulated, using population sizes and selection intensities relevant to cereal breeding. Control of Type I error was usually adequate with marker-based analysis of variance or trait-based testing using the normal approximation of the binomial distribution. Bidirectional selective genotyping was more powerful than unidirectional. Trait-based analysis and marker-based analysis of variance were about equally powerful. With genotyping of the best 30 out of 500 lines (6\%), a {QTL} explaining 15\% of the phenotypic variance could be detected with a power of 0.8 when tests were conducted at a marker 10 {cM} from the {QTL}. With bidirectional selective genotyping, {QTL} with smaller effects and ( or) {QTL} farther from the nearest marker could be detected. Similar {QTL} detection approaches were applied to data from a population of 436 recombinant inbred rice lines segregating for a large-effect {QTL} affecting grain yield under drought stress. That {QTL} was reliably detected by genotyping as few as 20 selected lines (4.5\%). In experimental populations, selective genotyping can reduce costs of {QTL} detection, allowing larger numbers of potential donors to be screened for useful alleles with effects across different backgrounds. In plant breeding programs, selective genotyping can make it possible to detect {QTL} using even a limited number of progeny that have been retained after selection.},

Microarray experiments were conducted using {RNA} isolated from germinal vesicle stage oocytes collected from adult versus prepubertal animals (model of poor oocyte competence). A total of 193 genes displaying greater {mRNA} abundance in adult oocytes and 223 genes displaying greater {mRNA} abundance in prepubertal oocytes were detected. Subsequent gene ontology analysis of microarray data revealed significant overrepresentation of transcripts encoding for genes in hormone secretion classification within adult oocytes and such genes were selected for further analysis. Real-time {PCR} experiments revealed greater abundance of {mRNA} for beta A and beta B subunits of inhibin/activin and follistatin, but not the alpha subunit in germinal vesicle stage oocytes collected from adult versus prepubertal animals. Cumulus cell follistatin and 08 subunit {mRNA} abundance were similar in samples collected from prepubertal versus adult animals. A positive association between time of first cleavage (oocyte competence) and follistatin {mRNA} abundance was noted. Follistatin, beta B, and alpha subunit {mRNAs} were temporally regulated during early bovine embryogenesis and peaked at the 16-cell stage.

From kidney tissue, we enriched phosphopeptides using titanium dioxide ({TiO}2) and quantified 10 562 phosphorylation events. Further analysis by phosphotyrosine peptide immunoprecipitation quantified an additional 592 phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation motif analysis revealed that the inhibitors decreased phosphorylation levels of proline-x-serine-proline ({PxSP}) and serine-proline ({SP}) sites, consistent with extracellular-signal-regulated kinase ({ERK}) inhibition. The {MEK} inhibitors had the greatest decrease on the phosphorylation of two proteins, Barttin and Slc12a3, which have roles in ion transport and fluid balance. Further studies will provide insight into the effect of these {MEK} inhibitors with respect to edema and other adverse events in mouse models and human patients.},

Sequence variation of surface-exposed proteins and cross-reactivity of the serogroup B capsular polysaccharide with human tissues have hampered efforts to develop a successful vaccine. To overcome these obstacles, the entire genome sequence bf a virulent serogroup B strain ({MC}58) was used to identify vaccine candidates. A total of 350 candidate antigens were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified. and used to immunize mice. The sera allowed the identification of proteins that are surface exposed, that are conserved in sequence across a range of strains, and that induce a bactericidal antibody response, a property known to correlate with vaccine efficacy in humans.},

	abstract = {{DNA} microarrays were rapidly scaled up from 256 to 6.5 million targets, and although antibody microarrays were proposed earlier, sensitive multiplex sandwich assays have only been scaled up to a few tens of targets. Cross-reactivity, arising because detection antibodies are mixed, is a known weakness of multiplex sandwich assays that is mitigated by lengthy optimization. Here, we introduce (1) vulnerability as a metric for assays. The vulnerability of multiplex sandwich assays to cross-reactivity increases quadratically with the number of targets, and together with experimental results, substantiates that scaling up of multiplex sandwich assays is unfeasible. We propose (2) a novel concept for multiplexing without mixing named antibody colocalization microarray ({ACM}). In {ACMs}, both capture and detection antibodies are physically colocalized by spotting to the same two-dimensional coordinate. Following spotting of the capture antibodies, the chip is removed from the arrayer, incubated with the sample, placed back onto the arrayer and then spotted with the detection antibodies. {ACMs} with up to 50 targets were produced, along with a binding curve for each protein. The {ACM} was validated by comparing it to {ELISA} and to a small-scale, conventional multiplex sandwich assay ({MSA}). Using {ACMs}, proteins in the serum of breast cancer patients and healthy controls were quantified, and six candidate biomarkers identified. Our results indicate that {ACMs} are sensitive, robust, and scalable. Molecular \& Cellular Proteomics 11: 10.1074/mcp.M111.011460, 1-12, 2012.},

The flexibility and low cost of {GBS} makes this an excellent tool for many applications and research questions in plant genetics and breeding. Here we address some of the new research opportunities that are becoming more feasible with {GBS}. Furthermore, we highlight areas in which {GBS} will become more powerful with the continued increase of sequencing output, development of reference genomes, and improvement of bioinformatics. The ultimate goal of plant biology scientists is to connect phenotype to genotype. In plant breeding, the genotype can then be used to predict phenotypes and select improved cultivars. Furthering our understanding of the connection between heritable genetic factors and the resulting phenotypes will enable genomics-assisted breeding to exist on the scale needed to increase global food supplies in the face of decreasing arable land and climate change.},

However, multicellular organisms typically contain many {CaM}-like ({CML}) proteins, and a global identification of their targets and specificity of interaction is lacking. in an effort to develop a platform for large-scale analysis of proteins in plants we have developed a protein microarray and used it to study the global analysis of {CaM}/{CML} interactions. An Arabidopsis thaliana expression collection containing 1,133 {ORFs} was generated and used to produce proteins with an optimized medium-throughput plant-based expression system. Protein microarrays were prepared and screened with several {CaMs}/{CMLs}. A large number of previously known and novel {CaM}/{CML} targets were identified, including transcription factors, receptor and intracellular protein kinases, F-box proteins, {RNA}-binding proteins, and proteins of unknown function. Multiple {CaM}/{CML} proteins bound many binding partners, but the majority of targets were specific to one or a few {CaMs}/{CMLs} indicating that different {CaM} family members function through different targets. Based on our analyses, the emergent {CaM}/{CML} interactome is more extensive than previously predicted. Our results suggest that calcium functions through distinct {CaM}/{CML} proteins to regulate a wide range of targets and cellular activities.},

	abstract = {The identification of genetic markers linked to genes of agronomic importance is a major aim of crop research and breeding programmes. Here, we identify markers for Yr15, a major disease resistance gene for wheat yellow rust, using a segregating F-2 population. After phenotyping, we implemented {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-Seq) of bulked pools to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP}) associated with Yr15. Over 27000 genes with {SNPs} were identified between the parents, and then classified based on the results from the sequenced bulks. We calculated the bulk frequency ratio ({BFR}) of {SNPs} between resistant and susceptible bulks, selecting those showing sixfold enrichment/depletion in the corresponding bulks ({BFR}{\textgreater}6). Using additional filtering criteria, we reduced the number of genes with a putative {SNP} to 175. The 35 {SNPs} with the highest {BFR} values were converted into genome-specific {KASP} assays using an automated bioinformatics pipeline ({PolyMarker}) which circumvents the limitations associated with the polyploid wheat genome. Twenty-eight assays were polymorphic of which 22 (63\%) mapped in the same linkage group as Yr15. Using these markers, we mapped Yr15 to a 0.77-{cM} interval. The three most closely linked {SNPs} were tested across varieties and breeding lines representing {UK} elite germplasm. Two flanking markers were diagnostic in over 99\% of lines tested, thus providing a reliable haplotype for marker-assisted selection in these breeding programmes. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be applied in polyploid F-2 populations to generate high-resolution genetic maps across target intervals.},

High throughput sequencing technology combined with 3D pooling of amplicons from 3072 M-2 plants was deployed for mutation screening.

Overall mutation density of one mutation per 1.423 million bases or similar to 3162 mutations per genome was observed in the population.

Additionally, mutants with traits such as increase in number of leaves and broader leaves were selected from the population and advanced to further generations. This study provided evidence to suggest that mutants with agronomic superior phenotypes identified by forward and reverse genetic approaches ({TILLING}) could contribute potentially towards crop improvement in tobacco.

Microarray analysis identified 720 salt-responsive genes, of which 695 were down-regulated and only 25 were up-regulated in the salt tolerant bulk. Gene ontology of annotated genes revealed that at least some of the identified salt responsive transcripts belong to pathways known to be associated with salt stress including osmolyte and lipid metabolism, cell wall structure, and membrane synthesis. About 48\% of all salt-responsive genes were functionally unknown. Quantitative {RT}-{PCR} was used to validate 17 selected salt responsive genes.

To dissect the genetic architecture underlying these differences, a quantitative trait locus ({QTL}) analysis was performed on the two segregating populations. Twenty-two flavonoid {QTLs} were detected that accounted for 11-64\% of the observed trait variations, only one {QTL} being common to both {RIL} sets. Sixteen of these {QTLs} were confirmed and coarsely mapped using heterogeneous inbred families ({HIFs}).

	abstract = {Selective genotyping of individuals from the two tails of the phenotypic distribution of a population provides a cost efficient alternative to analysis of the entire population for genetic mapping. Past applications of this approach have been confounded by the small size of entire and tail populations, and insufficient marker density, which result in a high probability of false positives in the detection of quantitative trait loci ({QTL}). We studied the effect of these factors on the power of {QTL} detection by simulation of mapping experiments using population sizes of up to 3,000 individuals and tail population sizes of various proportions, and marker densities up to one marker per {centiMorgan} using complex genetic models including {QTL} linkage and epistasis. The results indicate that {QTL} mapping based on selective genotyping is more powerful than simple interval mapping but less powerful than inclusive composite interval mapping. Selective genotyping can be used, along with pooled {DNA} analysis, to replace genotyping the entire population, for mapping {QTL} with relatively small effects, as well as linked and interacting {QTL}. Using diverse germplasm including all available genetics and breeding materials, it is theoretically possible to develop an "all-in-one plate" approach where one 384-well plate could be designed to map almost all agronomic traits of importance in a crop species. Selective genotyping can also be used for genomewide association mapping where it can be integrated with selective phenotyping approaches. We also propose a breeding-to-genetics approach, which starts with identification of extreme phenotypes from segregating populations generated from multiple parental lines and is followed by rapid discovery of individual genes and combinations of gene effects together with simultaneous manipulation in breeding programs.},

However, since it requires the development and selection of {DNA} markers for linkage analysis, {QTL} analysis has been time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here we report the rapid identification of plant {QTLs} by whole-genome resequencing of {DNAs} from two populations each composed of 2050 individuals showing extreme opposite trait values for a given phenotype in a segregating progeny. We propose to name this approach {QTL}-seq as applied to plant species. We applied {QTL}-seq to rice recombinant inbred lines and F2 populations and successfully identified {QTLs} for important agronomic traits, such as partial resistance to the fungal rice blast disease and seedling vigor.

The release of a reference diploid Gossypium raimondii (D-5) genome and bioinformatics tools to sort tetraploid reads into subgenomes has brought cotton genetic mapping into the genomics era. We used multiple high-throughput sequencing approaches to identify the relevant region of reference sequence and identify single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) near the short-fiber mutant Ligon-lintless 2 (Li (2)) gene locus. First, we performed {RNAseq} on 8-day post-anthesis ({DPA}) fiber cells from the Li (2) mutant and its wild type near isogenic line ({NIL}) Gossypium hirsutum cv. {DP}5690. We aligned sequence reads to the D-5 genome, sorted the reads into A and D subgenomes with {PolyCat} and called {SNPs} with {InterSNP}. We then identified {SNPs} that would result in non-synonymous substitutions to amino acid sequences of annotated genes. This step allowed us to identify a 1-Mb region with 24 non-synonymous {SNPs}, representing the introgressed region that differentiates Li (2) from its {NIL}.

Therefore, it is of interest to increase {aroA}/{EPSPS} gene diversity and seek new glyphosate-tolerant genes for developing glyphosate-tolerant crops. In the current study, {EPSPS} gene from Vitis vinifera ({VvEPSPS}) was cloned using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. However, wild type {VvEPSPS} cannot be directly used for developing transgenic crops because of its extreme glyphosate sensitivity. Recent studies have demonstrated that {DNA} shuffling is an effective strategy in producing multi-mutated {EPSPS} resourced from plants ({EPSPSplant}) with improved glyphosate resistance in bacteria and plants. After performing {DNA} shuffling on {VvEPSPS} gene, one highly glyphosate-resistant mutant with seven amino acid variations was isolated after five rounds of shuffling and screening. The mutant showed seven amino acid changes in the {EPSPS} gene, namely, Q93R, T113A, P117L, G126A, C160Y, N239H, and V343A.

	abstract = {Background: High density genotyping data are indispensable for genomic analyses of complex traits in animal and crop species. Maize is one of the most important crop plants worldwide, however a high density {SNP} genotyping array for analysis of its large and highly dynamic genome was not available so far. Results: We developed a high density maize {SNP} array composed of 616,201 variants ({SNPs} and small indels). Initially, 57 M variants were discovered by sequencing 30 representative temperate maize lines and then stringently filtered for sequence quality scores and predicted conversion performance on the array resulting in the selection of 1.2 M polymorphic variants assayed on two screening arrays. To identify high-confidence variants, 285 {DNA} samples from a broad genetic diversity panel of worldwide maize lines including the samples used for sequencing, important founder lines for European maize breeding, hybrids, and proprietary samples with European, {US}, semi-tropical, and tropical origin were used for experimental validation. We selected 616 k variants according to their performance during validation, support of genotype calls through sequencing data, and physical distribution for further analysis and for the design of the commercially available Affymetrix (R) Axiom (R) Maize Genotyping Array. This array is composed of 609,442 {SNPs} and 6,759 indels. Among these are 116,224 variants in coding regions and 45,655 {SNPs} of the Illumina (R) {MaizeSNP}50 {BeadChip} for study comparison. In a subset of 45,974 variants, apart from the target {SNP} additional off-target variants are detected, which show only a minor bias towards intermediate allele frequencies. We performed principal coordinate and admixture analyses to determine the ability of the array to detect and resolve population structure and investigated the extent of {LD} within a worldwide validation panel. Conclusions: The high density Affymetrix (R) Axiom (R) Maize Genotyping Array is optimized for European and American temperate maize and was developed based on a diverse sample panel by applying stringent quality filter criteria to ensure its suitability for a broad range of applications.

Swarna is an important rainfed lowland rice variety grown on millions of hectares in Asia, but is highly susceptible to drought and aerobic soil conditions. Apo is an aerobic-adapted variety with moderate tolerance to drought. Two rice microsatellite ({RM}) markers, {RM}324, and {RM}416, located on chromosomes 2 and 3, respectively, were shown via {BSA} to be strongly associated with yield under lowland drought stress. The effects of these {QTL} were tested in a total of eight hydrological environments over a period of 3 years. The {QTL} linked to {RM}416 ({DTY} (3.1) ) had a large effect on grain yield under severe lowland drought stress, explaining about 31\% of genetic variance for the trait (P {\textless} 0.0001). It also explained considerable variance for yield under mild stress in lowland conditions and aerobic environments. To our knowledge this is the first reported {QTL} that has a large effect on yield in both lowland drought and aerobic environments. The {QTL} linked to {RM}324 ({DTY} (2.1) ) had a highly significant effect on grain yield in lowland drought stress (R (2) = 13-16\%) and in two aerobic trials. The effect of these {QTL} on grain yield was verified to be not mainly due to phenology differences. Effects of {DTY} (3.1) on yield under stress have been observed in several other rice mapping populations studied at {IRRI}. Results of this study indicate that {BSA} is an effective method of identifying {QTL} alleles with large effects on rice yield under severe drought stress.

	abstract = {Background: Drought is one of the most important abiotic stresses causing drastic reductions in yield in rainfed rice environments. The suitability of grain yield ({GY}) under drought as a selection criterion has been reported in the past few years. Most of the quantitative trait loci ({QTLs}) for {GY} under drought in rice reported so far has been in the background of low-yielding susceptible varieties. Such {QTLs} have not shown a similar effect in multiple high-yielding drought-susceptible varieties, thus limiting their use in marker-assisted selection. Genetic control of {GY} under reproductive-stage drought stress ({RS}) in elite genetic backgrounds was studied in three F-3:4 mapping populations derived from crosses of N22, a drought-tolerant aus cultivar, with Swarna, {IR}64, and {MTU}1010, three high-yielding popular mega-varieties, with the aim to identify {QTLs} for {GY} under {RS} that show a consistent effect in multiple elite genetic backgrounds. Three populations were phenotyped under {RS} in the dry seasons ({DS}) of 2009 and 2010 at {IRRI}. For genotyping, whole-genome scans for N22/{MTU}1010 and bulked segregant analysis for N22/Swarna and N22/{IR}64 were employed using {SSR} markers. Results: A major {QTL} for {GY} under {RS}, {qDTY}(1.1), was identified on rice chromosome 1 flanked by {RM}11943 and {RM}431 in all three populations. In combined analysis over two years, {qDTY}(1.1) showed an additive effect of 29.3\%, 24.3\%, and 16.1\% of mean yield in N22/Swarna, N22/{IR}64, and N22/{MTU}1010, respectively, under {RS}. {qDTY}(1.1) also showed a positive effect on {GY} in non-stress ({NS}) situations in N22/Swarna, N22/{IR}64 over both years, and N22/{MTU}1010 in {DS}2009. Conclusions: This is the first reported {QTL} in rice with a major and consistent effect in multiple elite genetic backgrounds under both {RS} and {NS} situations.

The huge cost incurred in genotyping could be considered as a bottleneck in the process. Whole population genotyping ({WPG}), selective genotyping ({SG}), and bulk segregant analysis ({BSA}) approaches were employed for the identification of major grain-yield {QTLs} under drought in rice in the past few years. The efficiency of different {QTL} mapping approaches in identifying major-effect grain-yield {QTLs} under drought in rice was compared using phenotypic and genotypic data of two recombinant inbred line populations, Basmati334/Swarna and N22/{MTU}1010. All three genotyping approaches were efficient in identifying consistent-effect {QTLs} with an additive effect of 10\% or more. Comparative analysis revealed that {SG} and {BSA} required 63.5\% and 92.1\% fewer data points, respectively, than {WPG} in the N22/{MTU}1010 F-3:4 mapping population. The {BSA} approach successfully detected consistent-effect drought grain-yield {QTLs} {qDTY}(1.1) and {qDTY}(8.1) detected by {WPG} and {SG}. Unlike {SG}, {BSA} did not lead to an upward estimation of the additive effect and phenotypic variance.

Nuclear genes provide possible targets for improving photosynthetic efficiency. Hence, genome-wide identification and characterization of the nuclear genes affecting photosynthetic traits in woody plants would provide key insights on genetic regulation of photosynthesis and identify candidate processes for improvement of photosynthesis. Results: Using microarray and bulked segregant analysis strategies, we identified differentially expressed nuclear genes for photosynthesis traits in a segregating population of poplar. We identified 515 differentially expressed genes in this population ({FC} {\textgreater}= 2 or {FC} {\textless}= 0.5, P {\textless} 0.05), 163 up-regulated and 352 down-regulated. Real-time {PCR} expression analysis confirmed the microarray data. Singular Enrichment Analysis identified 48 significantly enriched {GO} terms for molecular functions (28), biological processes (18) and cell components (2). Furthermore, we selected six candidate genes for functional examination by a single-marker association approach, which demonstrated that 20 {SNPs} in five candidate genes significantly associated with photosynthetic traits, and the phenotypic variance explained by each {SNP} ranged from 2.3\% to 12.6\%. This revealed that regulation of photosynthesis by the nuclear genome mainly involves transport, metabolism and response to stimulus functions. Conclusions: This study provides new genome-scale strategies for the discovery of potential candidate genes affecting photosynthesis in Populus, and for identification of the functions of genes involved in regulation of photosynthesis. This work also suggests that improving photosynthetic efficiency under field conditions will require the consideration of multiple factors, such as stress responses.},

In this study, we explored differentially expressed genes between the russet-and green-pericarp offspring from the sand pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) cv. 'Qingxiang' x 'Cuiguan' F1 group by {RNA}-seq-based bulked segregant analysis ({BSA}). A total of 29,100 unigenes were identified and 206 of which showed significant differences in expression level (log(2)fold values{\textgreater}1) between the two types of pericarp pools. Gene Ontology ({GO}) analyses detected 123 unigenes in {GO} terms related to 'cellular\_component' and 'biological\_process', suggesting developmental and growth differentiations between the two types. {GO} categories associated with various aspects of 'lipid metabolic processes', 'transport', 'response to stress', 'oxidation-reduction process' and more were enriched with genes with divergent expressions between the two libraries. Detailed examination of a selected set of these categories revealed repressed expressions of candidate genes for suberin, cutin and wax biosynthesis in the russet pericarps. Genes encoding putative cinnamoyl-{CoA} reductase ({CCR}), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase ({CAD}) and peroxidase ({POD}) that are involved in the lignin biosynthesis were suggested to be candidates for pigmentation of sand pear russet pericarps. Nine differentially expressed genes were analyzed for their expressions using {qRT}-{PCR} and the results were consistent with those obtained from Illumina {RNA}-sequencing.

However, because there are no assays for the majority of proteins and de novo immunoassay development is prohibitively expensive, few candidate biomarkers are tested in clinical studies. We tested whether the analytical performance of a biomarker identification pipeline based on targeted mass spectrometry would be sufficient for data-dependent prioritization of candidate biomarkers, de novo development of assays and multiplexed biomarker verification. We used a data-dependent triage process to prioritize a subset of putative plasma biomarkers from {\textgreater} 1,000 candidates previously identified using a mouse model of breast cancer. Eighty-eight novel quantitative assays based on selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry were developed, multiplexed and evaluated in 80 plasma samples. Thirty-six proteins were verified as being elevated in the plasma of tumor-bearing animals. The analytical performance of this pipeline suggests that it should support the use of an analogous approach with human samples.},

	abstract = {Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) remains the sole commercial source for several pharmaceutical alkaloids including the narcotic analgesics codeine and morphine, and the semi-synthetic drugs oxycodone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. Although most of the biosynthetic genes have been identified, the post-transcriptional regulation of the morphinan alkaloid pathway has not been determined. We have used virus-induced gene silencing ({VIGS}) as a functional genomics tool to investigate the regulation of morphine biosynthesis via a systematic reduction in enzyme levels responsible for the final six steps in the pathway. Specific gene silencing was confirmed at the transcript level by real-time quantitative {PCR} (polymerase chain reaction), and at the protein level by immunoblot analysis using antibodies raised against salutaridine synthase ({SalSyn}), salutaridine reductase ({SalR}), salutaridine 7-O-acetyltransferase ({SalAT}), thebaine 6-O-demethylase (T6ODM), codeinone reductase ({COR}), and codeine O-demethylase ({CODM}). In some cases, silencing a specific biosynthetic gene resulted in a predictable accumulation of the substrate for the corresponding enzyme. Reduced {SalSyn}, {SalR}, T6ODM and {CODM} protein levels correlated with lower morphine levels and a substantial increase in the accumulation of reticuline, salutaridine, thebaine and codeine, respectively. In contrast, the silencing of genes encoding {SalAT} and {COR} resulted in the accumulation of salutaridine and reticuline, respectively, which are not the corresponding enzymatic substrates. The silencing of alkaloid biosynthetic genes using {VIGS} confirms the physiological function of enzymes previously characterized in vitro, provides insight into the biochemical regulation of morphine biosynthesis, and demonstrates the immense potential for metabolic engineering in opium poppy.},

This results in a high proportion of published markers failing at one or more of the translation steps i from research arena to application domain. The rate of success is likely to increase due to developments in gene-based marker development, More efficient quantitative trait locus ({QTL}) mapping procedures, and lower cost genotyping systems. However, some fundamental remain to be resolved, particularly regarding complex traits, before marker-assisted selection realizes its full potential in public sector breed ing programs.

Molecular marker-assisted breeding procedures can be facilitated and revolutionized through whole-genome strategies, which utilize full genome sequencing and genome-wide molecular markers to effectively address various genomic and environmental factors through a representative or complete set of genetic resources and breeding materials. These strategies are now increasingly based on understanding of specific genomic regions, genes/alleles, haplotypes, linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) block(s), gene networks and their contribution to specific phenotypes. Large-scale and high-density genotyping and genome-wide selection are two important components of these strategies. As components of whole-genome strategies, molecular breeding platforms and methodologies should be backed up by high throughput and precision phenotyping and e-typing (environmental assay) with strong support systems such as breeding informatics and decision support tools. Some basic strategies are discussed in this article, including (1) seed {DNA}-based genotyping for simplifying marker-assisted selection ({MAS}), reducing breeding cost and increasing scale and efficiency, (2) selective genotyping and phenotyping, combined with pooled {DNA} analysis, for capturing the most important contributing factors, (3) flexible genotyping systems, such as genotyping by sequencing and arraying, refined for different selection methods including {MAS}, marker-assisted recurrent selection and genomic selection ({GS}), (4) marker-trait association analysis using joint linkage and {LD} mapping, and (5) sequence-based strategies for marker development, allele mining, gene discovery and molecular breeding.},

	volume = {48},
	issn = {0578-1752},
	abstract = {Global climate changes have increasing impacts on worldwide environments. Crop productivity is largely determined by interaction between the genotype a crop has and the environment surrounding the crop plants. With modern biotechnologies, genotypic contribution to a phenotype can be dissected at molecular level into individual genetic components. However, the environmental factors that have significant impacts on crops have not been dissected individually, and thus their contribution to phenotype can be only inferred by their integrative effect under different types of environments, or described for the whole experimental plot by comparing pairwise major environmental factors. The author proposed a concept of environmental assay for the first time by coining a word "etyping", which represents "envirotyping", a more suitable word used in this article. The term "envirotype" is used to describe all internal and external environmental factors and their combinations that affect plants across growth and developmental stages. The external environmental factors include moisture, fertilizers, air, temperature, light, soil properties, cropping system and companion organisms. Envirotyping refers to dissecting and measuring all these environmental factors. Environmental information can be collected through various approaches, including multi-environmental trials with environmental data accumulated related to trial locations; geographic and soil information systems containing environmental data for climate, weather, and soil; and small weather stations that collect factors related to weather, precipitation, temperature and air. Using remote sensing and other instruments, many external environmental factors can be measured for plant canopy, plant surroundings, and even for single plots or individual plants. Environmental information will be increasingly used for environment characterization, genotype-by-environment interaction analysis, phenotype prediction, disease epidemic prediction, near iso-environment construction, understanding of the response of plants to specific environmental factors, agronomic genomics, and precision farming. In the future, envirotyping needs to be improved to zoom into specific plots and individual plants across growth and developmental stages, along with the development of integrative information system and decision support tools to bring genotypic, phenotypic and envirotypic information together. Envirotypic information will finally contribute as a third dimension to the crop research and development system involving genotype-phenotype-envirotype complex. Such efforts will help establish a high-efficient crop breeding and production system based on the concept of the three-dimensional profile.},

We also review the use of candidate genes and gene-based markers in maize association mapping studies that has generated particularly promising results. In addition, we examine recent developments in genome-wide genotyping techniques that promise to improve the power of association mapping and significantly refine our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex quantitative traits. The new challenges and opportunities associated with genome-wide analysis studies are discussed.

Several high throughput platforms have been developed that allow rapid and simultaneous genotyping of up to a million {SNP} markers. In this study, a custom {GoldenGate} assay containing 1,536 {SNPs} was developed based on public {SNP} information for maize and used to genotype two recombinant inbred line ({RIL}) populations (Zong3 x 87-1, and B73 x By804) and a panel of 154 diverse inbred lines. Over 90\% of the {SNPs} were successfully scored in the diversity panel and the two {RIL} populations, with a genotyping error rate of less than 2\%. A total of 975 {SNP} markers detected polymorphism in at least one of the two mapping populations, with a polymorphic rate of 38.5\% in Zong3 x 87-1 and 52.6\% in B73 x By804. The polymorphic {SNPs} in B73 x By804 have been integrated with previously mapped simple sequence repeat markers to construct a high-density linkage map containing 662 markers with a total length of 1,673.7 {cM} and an average of 2.53 {cM} between two markers. The minor allelic frequency ({MAF}) was distributed evenly across 10 continued classes from 0.05 to 0.5, and about 16\% of the {SNP} markers had a {MAF} below 10\% in the diversity panel. Polymorphism rates for individual {SNP} markers in pair-wise comparisons of genotypes tested ranged from 0.3 to 63.8\% with an average of 36.3\%.

Here we report a method for performing {GWAS} that does not require genotyping of large numbers of individuals. Instead {XP}-{GWAS} (extreme-phenotype {GWAS}) relies on genotyping pools of individuals from a diversity panel that have extreme phenotypes. This analysis measures allele frequencies in the extreme pools, enabling discovery of associations between genetic variants and traits of interest. This method was evaluated in maize (Zea mays) using the well-characterized kernel row number trait, which was selected to enable comparisons between the results of {XP}-{GWAS} and conventional {GWAS}. An exome-sequencing strategy was used to focus sequencing resources on genes and their flanking regions. A total of 0.94 million variants were identified and served as evaluation markers; comparisons among pools showed that 145 of these variants were statistically associated with the kernel row number phenotype. These trait-associated variants were significantly enriched in regions identified by conventional {GWAS}. {XP}-{GWAS} was able to resolve several linked {QTL} and detect trait-associated variants within a single gene under a {QTL} peak. {XP}-{GWAS} is expected to be particularly valuable for detecting genes or alleles responsible for quantitative variation in species for which extensive genotyping resources are not available, such as wild progenitors of crops, orphan crops, and other poorly characterized species such as those of ecological interest.},

Genetic analysis of different F-2 and backcross populations revealed that one single recessive gene, u (uniform immature fruit color), determines the uniform immature fruit color trait in cucumber. Based on earlier studies, the u locus is located on chromosome 5 (Chr. 5). By combining bulked segregant analysis using 60 published molecular markers on Chr. 5, we found that eight markers are polymorphic and are linked to the u locus. In addition, we developed five new relevant polymorphic simple sequence repeat ({SSR}) markers between markers {SSR}16203 and {SSR}15818. Subsequently, the F-2 population (477 individuals) from the cross of S06 (uniform fruit color line) x S94 (mottled fruit color line) was used for fine mapping of the u gene. The u gene was mapped to a 313.2-kb region between markers {SSR}10 and {SSR}27, at a genetic distance of 0.8 and 0.5 {cM}, respectively. Moreover, validity analysis of the codominant markers {SSR}10 and {SSR}27 was performed using 50 lines with mottled/uniform fruit color, demonstrating that these two {SSR} markers can be used for marker-assisted selection of the mottled/uniform fruit color trait in cucumber breeding.

Nine rice orthologs of Arabidopsis genes encoding key enzymes in lipid metabolism co-localized with 11 mapped {QTLs}. A strong {QTL} for oleic (18: 1) and linoleic (18: 2) acid were associated with a rice ortholog of a gene encoding acyl-{CoA}: diacylglycerol acyltransferase ({DGAT}), and another for palmitic acid (16: 0) mapped similarly to the {acylACP} thioesterase ({FatB}) gene ortholog.

For triage of these patients, cardiac biomarkers troponin I and T are endorsed as standard indicators for acute myocardial infarction ({AMI}, or heart attack). Thus, there is significant interest in developing a rapid, point-of-care ({POC}) device for troponin detection. In this work, a rapid, quantitative, and label-free assay, which is specific for cardiac troponin T ({cTnT}) detection, using fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes ({SWCNTs}), is demonstrated. Chitosan-wrapped carbon nanotubes are cross-linked to form a thin gel that is further functionalized with nitrilotriacetic acid ({NTA}) moieties. Upon chelation of Ni2+, the Ni2+-{NTA} group binds to a hexa-histidine-modified troponin antibody, which specifically recognizes the target protein, troponin T. As the troponin T binds to the antibody, the local environment of the sensor changes, allowing direct troponin detection through intensity changes in {SWCNT} bandgap fluorescence. This platform represents the first near-infrared {SWCNT} sensor array for {cTnT} detection. Detection can be completed within 5 min, demonstrating a linear response to {cTnT} concentration and an experimental detection limit of 100 ng {mL}(-1) (2.5 nm). This platform provides a promising new tool for {POC} {AMI} detection in the future.

	abstract = {One of the most important applications of genomic selection in maize breeding is to predict and identify the best untested lines from biparental populations, when the training and validation sets are derived from the same cross. Nineteen tropical maize biparental populations evaluated in multienvironment trials were used in this study to assess prediction accuracy of different quantitative traits using low-density (similar to 200 markers) and genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}), respectively. An extension of the Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Predictor that incorporates genotype x environment ({GE}) interaction was used to predict genotypic values; cross-validation methods were applied to quantify prediction accuracy. Our results showed that: (1) low-density {SNPs} (similar to 200 markers) were largely sufficient to get good prediction in biparental maize populations for simple traits with moderate-to-high heritability, but {GBS} outperformed low-density {SNPs} for complex traits and simple traits evaluated under stress conditions with low-to-moderate heritability; (2) heritability and genetic architecture of target traits affected prediction performance, prediction accuracy of complex traits (grain yield) were consistently lower than those of simple traits (anthesis date and plant height) and prediction accuracy under stress conditions was consistently lower and more variable than under well-watered conditions for all the target traits because of their poor heritability under stress conditions; and (3) the prediction accuracy of {GE} models was found to be superior to that of non-{GE} models for complex traits and marginal for simple traits.},

However, large collections of variants for this purpose often are unavailable to research communities. We introduce a workflow to generate reliable collections of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and indels by leveraging available genomic resources to inform variant calling using the {GATK}. The workflow is demonstrated for the crop plant Sorghum bicolor by (i) generating an initial set of variants using reduced representation sequence data from an experimental cross and association panels, (ii) using the initial variants to inform variant calling from whole-genome sequence data of resequenced individuals, and (iii) using variants identified from whole-genome sequence data for recalibration of the reduced representation sequence data. The reliability of variants called with the workflow is verified by comparison with genetically mappable variants from an independent sorghum experimental cross. Comparison with a recent sorghum resequencing study shows that the workflow identifies an additional 1.62 million high-confidence variants from the same sequence data. Finally, the workflow’s performance is validated using Arabidopsis sequence data, yielding variant call sets with 95\% sensitivity and 99\% positive predictive value. The Recalibration and Interrelation of genomic sequence data with the {GATK} ({RIG}) workflow enables the {GATK} to accurately identify genetic variation in organisms lacking validated variant resources.},

Whole-genome duplications have shaped the history of all flowering plants and present challenges to elucidating the relationship between genotype and phenotype, especially in neopolyploid species. Although single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) have become popular tools for genetic mapping, discovery and application of {SNPs} in polyploids has been difficult. Here, we summarize common experimental approaches to {SNP} calling, highlighting recent polyploid successes. To examine the impact of software choice on these analyses, we called {SNPs} among five peanut genotypes using different alignment programs ({BWA}-mem and Bowtie 2) and variant callers ({SAMtools}, {GATK}, and Freebayes). Alignments produced by Bowtie 2 and {BWA}-mem and analyzed in {SAMtools} shared 24.5\% concordant {SNPs}, and {SAMtools}, {GATK}, and Freebayes shared 1.4\% concordant {SNPs}. A subsequent analysis of simulated Brassica napus chromosome 1A and 1C genotypes demonstrated that, of the three software programs, {SAMtools} performed with the highest sensitivity and specificity on Bowtie 2 alignments. These results, however, are likely to vary among species, and we therefore propose a series of best practices for {SNP} calling in polyploids.},

Three {QTL} of comparable magnitude on three different linkage groups were identified.

This plant differs strikingly from its close relative A. thaliana by accumulating Zn specifically in above-ground tissues. A. thaliana {GeneChips} were used in order to identify, on a transcriptome-wide scale, genes with a potential involvement in cellular metal uptake or detoxification in the shoots of A. halleri. Compared to A. thaliana, transcript abundance of several genes was found and confirmed to be substantially higher in A. halleri after 4 days of exposure to low as well as high Zn concentrations in the hydroponic culture medium. The identified candidate genes encode proteins closely related to the following A. thaliana proteins: {AtZIP}6, a putative cellular Zn uptake system and member of the zinc-regulated transporter ({ZRT})-iron regulated transporter ({IRT})-like protein ({ZIP})-family of metal transporters, the putative P-type metal {ATPase} {AtHMA}3, the cation diffusion facilitator {ZAT}/{AtCDF}1, and the nicotianamine synthase {AtNAS}3. Heterologous expression in mutant strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggested that {AhHMA}3, {AhCDF}1-3, and {AhNAS}3 can function in cellular Zn detoxification. Our data indicate that, at the transcript level, the Zn tolerance strategy of A. halleri involves high constitutive expression of metal homeostasis genes in the shoots to accommodate higher basal levels of Zn accumulation, and possibly to prepare for sudden increases in Zn influx into shoot cells. Furthermore, profiling of metal homeostasis gene transcripts in shoot and root tissues by real-time {RT}-{PCR} indicated that A. halleri and A. thaliana respond differently to changes in plant Zn status.},

	abstract = {Background
Microsatellite markers are widely used for estimating genetic diversity within and differentiation among populations. However, it has rarely been tested whether such estimates are useful proxies for genome-wide patterns of variation and differentiation. Here, we compared microsatellite variation with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) to assess and quantify potential marker-specific biases and derive recommendations for future studies. Overall, we genotyped 180 Arabidopsis halleri individuals from nine populations using 20 microsatellite markers. Twelve of these markers were originally developed for Arabidopsis thaliana (cross-species markers) and eight for A. halleri (species-specific markers). We further characterized 2 million {SNPs} across the genome with a pooled whole-genome re-sequencing approach (Pool-Seq).

Results
Our analyses revealed that estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation derived from cross-species and species-specific microsatellites differed substantially and that expected microsatellite heterozygosity ({SSR}-H
e) was not significantly correlated with genome-wide {SNP} diversity estimates ({SNP}-H
e and θ
Watterson) in A. halleri. Instead, microsatellite allelic richness (A
r) was a better proxy for genome-wide {SNP} diversity. Estimates of genetic differentiation among populations (F
{ST}) based on both marker types were correlated, but microsatellite-based estimates were significantly larger than those from {SNPs}. Possible causes include the limited number of microsatellite markers used, marker ascertainment bias, as well as the high variance in microsatellite-derived estimates. In contrast, genome-wide {SNP} data provided unbiased estimates of genetic diversity independent of whether genome- or only exome-wide {SNPs} were used. Further, we inferred that a few thousand random {SNPs} are sufficient to reliably estimate genome-wide diversity and to distinguish among populations differing in genetic variation.

Conclusions
We recommend that future analyses of genetic diversity within and differentiation among populations use randomly selected high-throughput sequencing-based {SNP} data to draw conclusions on genome-wide diversity patterns. In species comparable to A. halleri, a few thousand {SNPs} are sufficient to achieve this goal.

	abstract = {Species closely related to model organisms present the opportunity to efficiently apply molecular and functional tools developed by a large research community to taxa with different ecological and evolutionary histories. We complied 42 microsatellite loci that amplify under common conditions in four closely related Arabidopsis: A. thaliana; A. halleri; A. lyrata ssp. lyrata; and A. lyrata ssp. petraea, as well as in one more distantly related crucifer; Arabis drummondii. Variation at these loci is amenable to a diversity of applications including population genetics, phylogeographical analyses, mapping of inter and intraspecific crosses, and recombination mapping. Our analysis of microsatellite variation illustrates significant differences in population genetic parameters among three Arabidopsis species. A population of A. thaliana, an inbreeding annual plant associated with disturbed habitats, was highly monomorphic (P = 8\% percent polymorphic loci) and only 0.2\% heterozygous for 648 locus-by-individual combinations. A population of the self-incompatible perennial herb, A. halleri, was more genetically variable (P = 71\%) and had an excess of heterozygosity that may reflect a recent population bottleneck associated with human-mediated founder events. A population of the self-incompatible perennial herb, A. lyrata ssp. petraea, was even more genetically variable (P = 86\%) and appeared to be at mutation-drift equilibrium. Population structure estimated from neutrally evolving loci provides an empirical expectation against which hypotheses of adaptive evolution at functional loci can be tested.},
